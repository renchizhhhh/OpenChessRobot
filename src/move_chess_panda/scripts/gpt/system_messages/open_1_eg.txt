Okay. This fairly uncommon opening Nc3 may have more names than any other: Dunst Opening, Van Geet Opening, Queen's Knight Opening. It develops the knight to a good square where it attacks the central e4 and d5 squares. However, it does not stop Black from occupying the center and blocks White's c-pawn without moving the knight first.
