"Sounds very technical to me, I didn't find it easy to understand. But the voice was very clear"
"It seems to understand the chess game as moves smoothly and effectively "
"Its explanation is over technical "
"The robot moves very smoothly, while calculating each piece. It has a direct manner and the arm or “fingers” look like they’re very well at gripping the chess pieces."
"The robot seems to be well-built and articulates it's thought process clearly via its artificial voice. "
"Positive: it explains it's actions clearly. Negative: it uses quite a lot of terminology, that students might be struggle to understand."
"Clear dialogue and movement to demonstrate."
"it didnt explain much on how it can play chess"
"Technical quality seems good, movements are very fluid."
"Looks very futuristic. The movement is smooth and sharp. The voice is a little harsh but clear and direct."
"I found the robot to be very concise, knowledgeable and well spoken. My only hesitation in putting it in classroom's with children to explain concepts is that it used very high level vocabulary, which may elude or confuse a younger audience. The tone of voice was very pleasant!"
"Technical quality was good because it was precise and clear."
"It looks very informative and interesting so would be capturing people's or student's attention but can it repeat again if a different way if people don't understand its explanation? Can it respond to questions if someone has any?"
"I think the robot should be a little human like"
"The language is clear and easy to understand. The movement from the robot makes watching and listening to the explanation interest."
"The robots language was precise and easy to understand. The voice seemed to have a bit of an echo that seemed inappropriate given the setting it was in."
"It’s providing information that isn’t related to chess.  It’s impressive technology."
"it sounded very technical and descriptive"
"Whilst it seems like a generic robot you'd see in a factory of sorts the added voice really gets across the point that it's working hard and making decisions. It's also impressive how precise it's movements are. "
"On the negative side it is dependant on the four corner squares. I also wonder what would happen if the board was knocked over. On the positive side it seems clever and would impress children. "
"It looks still a little rough around the edges."
"Positive is that it explains its 'thought' process on how it will operate. However, it is not clear how these operations actually take place."
"The robot is impressive on the way it moves and the explanations that it is providing."
"I think the robot looks great and the explaination is very clear as to what it is doing as it moves. I think without more information it is hard to discuss the technical quality"
"Futuristic - the robot looks like it could be really useful - slightly distracting if playing a game of chess with it - could it be made smaller or moved back?"
"It seems very intelligent and impressive"
"Robot seems very good. Has full range of movement and relevant sensors to detect pieces. Accurately vocalises its processes"
"The robot looks and sounds technically competent. The video, however, does not show the robot in action. We can only expect that it will function as expected."
"The technical quality of the robot is very good, it is very clear"
"the way it moves and talks through what it is doing is a positive - a negative for me is that I think it is quite creepy  "
"this robot clearly states how it maps each piece clearly but it does not state how the algorithm works when moving a piece"
"The robot moves swiftly - positive, it is understanding the board"
"Seems to move well and not too noisily [sound could still be a distraction for aurally sensitive students]. Clamp seems secure and the base of the robot takes up a small surface area. Voice is clear and I'm sure can be adjusted for speed and pitch"
"Technical quality seems fine, the movement is a little loud"
"Looks brilliant and the size of it makes it even more clever! Usually this kind of tech involves much bigger components! "
"The way the robot moved around, scanning the board, and voicing exactly what it was doing was very smooth and very direct. It looked like it was a very well built robot."
"It looks sophisticated enough but also simple and clean. The tutorial is a bit rigid and autonomous. It does not feel ""personal"" to me although it appears to achieve the purpose for what it was designed."
"Positive -clear and easy to understand  Negative- far to complex and complicated to follow "
"From what I heard from the robot, I understood the logic. It was simple enough to understand but not in a 'dumb it down' way."
"The robot movements are fine but I have no clue what the terms its using means. Also kind if distracting to watch what it is doing while talking."
"Its too monotoned and boring"
"The robot seems sleek"
"looks good for playing chess"
"The robot's explanation of how it works and the corresponding movement of the robot is excellent as it explains it both verbally and visually in a way a normal person would explain something."
"The robot arm has a very clean and futuristic look. It appears to move very smoothly. From the way it looks I do not doubt its capability."
"The robot is able to move a full spherical radius around its center to move the chess pieces on the board"
"The robot can play chess without thinking and without making errors a human could make."
"Technically the robot looks and sounds very impressive, and professional."
"The robot demonstrates high precision in identifying and moving chess pieces, showing strong mechanical and vision capabilities. However, its response time could be optimized for smoother interaction in an educational setting."
"The robotic arm exhibits thorough design elements for chess play through exact controls and visual detection features along with built-in security mechanisms. Automated and stable operation makes the system a notable interactive platform. The robot suffers from three main disadvantages: its reduced speed in movement while exhibiting restricted mechanics for complicated chess moves and inconsistent performance when identifying board scenarios. This system shows potential as an advanced piece of technology although further enhancements are possible."
"The technical terminology is a little above my head. You need to explain what an ArUco marker is. I'm assuming that it is those squares on each corner that look like QR codes. "
"It looks fine, would need to see it in person to give an accurate review. It appears to work well and it's a good colour."
"It has good capabilities - vision, speech, movement. The robot's movements were smooth, its voice was clear, and it's explanation suggests its vision is effective."
"His voice was clear and you could understand him, he used easy to understand language."
"The speech is very clear, I like that the robot moves while it is telling what it is doing. This will give a great lesson for kids."
"The robots seem well built and the explanation of how the robot thinks is good. One negative thing is though is that it takes too long for the robot to do an actual move. "
"The robot looks very quality and shows good mobility but it's not clear from the video if it can lift and move objects"
"It looks good sleek and modern."
"It's motion is fluid which is a positive. But I think there is a simpler way for the robot to see the board and map out the chess board, it moves too much for the task that is required."
"I feel that the language is too technical and sophisticated for school-age children. But the movement of the robot helps understand what message it intends to convey. "
"I think this robot is a great invention it is very intelligent and very clever "
"It looks robust as well as manipulative."
"It looks great. Works smoothly and I can  see how it operates. "
"Technical quality of the robot seems fine. Perfectly workable robot."
"It seems to have good range of movement but it is a bit slow and the voice is quite loud and frightening "
"Sounds generic, the speed to which it speaks needs to be reduced"
"Its flexibility and ability to rotate is impressive. I also like that it looks like it's a little person wearing lab goggles."
"One positive aspect is it's ability to detect the position of chess pieces on the board. The negative aspect is that it needs the ArUco markers to detect the board. "
"The robot certainly looks of high technical quality, it has a high degree of moment and the short demo shows this off. We didn't see it pick up a piece so it's hard to tell if that would have positively or negatively effected the perception of technical ability. The robot and voice interaction was also good, in the sense the movement seemed to be enhanced or emphasising what was being said."
"It seems well made and able to map a chess board."
"it is easy to understand"
"I believe the robot has a good quality. It clearly explained what is happening at the time while it makes a move. The video makes me understand how the robot works. However I do  also thing that language can be a bit completicated for some of the students  depending on age."
"The robot seems fairly sophisticated.  It is good that it explains how it is analyzing the board.  However, the robot takes a while to determine which chess piece is in which position."
"Looks and sounds very engaging. Does use quite technical language which might loose some audiences?"
"It seems competent and speaks well while it explains how it works."
"It looks pretty impressive. Runs quite smoothly, and although not entirely quiet, the sound it makes is not annoying. The arm seems to be moving precisely"
"It explains what it's doing well and it speaks in a natural manner"
"It sounds robotic which can be distracting"
"the quality of the robot was very positive and appeared accurate"
"I do not have any comments on the technical quality of the robot as shown in the video."
"I think the quality of the robot looks good for this application. It is just complicated enough to get the specific job of playing chess. Robots should be task specific (maybe a few different tasks) they should not be a jack of all trades."
"The robot looks well made and moves fluidly. Its movements look to correspond with the voice as it explains what it is doing as it checks the different areas of the chessboard."
" the robot as shown in the video fair but not good for school because the robot as shown in the video may not be like human"
"the positive is the robot is very precise by being able to take the coordinates and mapping out the chess board. I can't think of any negative aspects apart from maybe it takes more time."
"Ability of the robot to read the chessboard and make a decision about the movement."
"The robot looks functional and is able to locate and move pieces. As I understood, it is also capable of playing chess with AI supported intelligence. So it allows playing chess against a computer in real life. However, the robot also looks bulky, heavy, and occupies a large space on the table, which might be considered as a downside."
"The explanation was quite descriptive with a very loud audio output"
"It appears its moves, are very accurate and precise and it is putting down the places, and explaining where it is putting them down very well. "
"Looks to be very high tech with smooth movements and complex mapping and visual sensors that allow it to completely automate a game of chess."
"The robot displayed good technical quality as it aligned its visionary capabilities to the chess board. "
"The robot itself is good quality. It's speech and movements are clear, concise, and deliberate. "
"Technical quality is great. Movements are smooth and the AI generated voice is clear and easy to understand."
"It has smooth and precise motions and seems to be studying the chess board with its intelligent movements."
"It seems very accurate in its placement and instruction quality."
"The robot's movement was impressive, and his audio was also impressive and very clear. It would be hard for a school child to follow. The robot communicated his moves using a vocabulary that was full of technical terms and difficult words and somewhat beyond the comprehension of a school-age child."
"This robot will work best for intelligent students. Students with special education need might struggle to understand what is being taught"
"it seemed very impressive"
"the robot explains its process very well, and sounds smart and friendly."
"It may not have the patience for younger scholars at an elementary level "
"I don't know what a ArUco is, that needs to be explained. I don't know what ""occupancy and piece classification"" really details. The robot itself looks very good and advanced "
"The technical quality of the robot appears impressive, particularly in its ability to recognize chess pieces and articulate its thought process using AI. The integration of computer vision and ChatGPT-like explanations makes it both functional and interactive. A potential downside could be the speed or accuracy of piece recognition—if there are delays or errors, that might hinder its usability. Additionally, the clarity of speech and naturalness of its responses could be areas for improvement."
"positive: combined mechanical control with advanced AI and now physically interacting with a chessboard. negative: system might struggle under varying lighting conditions or with different board designs"
"Personally I did not know what an aruco code was, but given the context of the video I was able to infer the purpose of an aruco code.  I think it was clear how the robot is able use the chess board, but it was not clear to me how the robot is able to identify each chess piece on the board."
"The explanation of what the robot is doing is confusing, but the robot seems to be high quality."
"THE CLARITY OF THE VOICE IS QUITE GOOD BUT THE BULKINESS IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT"
"I appreciate the level of detail the robot took to explain its reasoning. It's more believable that it knows what it's doing when it explains exactly how it can ""see"" the board."
"The way it analyzes systematically the chess board is very methodic. The positive side is that there is a step-by-step explanation of how the data is recorded and the voice is clear and precise without any extra unnecessary comments. The negative aspects could be that the robot could not be able to properly answer any questions that arise if the question itself is not properly formulated."
"The robot looks well built, with good mobility and smooth movement in the arm that extends over the chess board."
"it was loud and slow"
"In terms of being a chess-playing robot, it seems to be fine, although I'd worry about getting smacked on the head if I were playing against it. The voice explanation seems to be a different program, and I suppose it's fine, too, although I'm not sure why an LLM-generated explanation in first person is better than a human-written explanation in third person."
"Robots are becoming increasingly sophisticated due to advancements in mechanical design, electronics, sensors, and AI.  the robot above shows an increase in efficiency, improved quality, enhanced safety, and new possibilities. However, concerns exist regarding job displacement, ethical implications, cost, reliability, and safety.  "
"It’s good technology only drawbacks are lack of jobs for humans if we replace them with human jobs "
"quite good, looks authentic and moves well, with a sound that's relatable"
"It looks like it does a great job explaining and showing how it functions, but the language could be too complex for students to understand."
"I like how the robot is showing the actual placement were its going to move."
"The robot is very technical and explains what it is doing. Some of the words sound too technical to understand."
"Okay so the technical quality of the robot, I would say it would be above my expectations. As the robot explained quite well how it does look at chessboard, how the 3D print and mapping of the whole chessboard is made. As well as how it chooses the way or route it does to ensure that it efficiently Wins the game of chess!"
"The talking robot is one step towards a full-functioning Android machine in the future. This could be beneficial and dangerous because we don't know how a machine would react to conscience and sentient thought. "
"Not entirely sure I understood exactly what it meant. Speaking pace was slow and could potentially become boring/easy to lose focus."
"The robot may work well, but we don’t see that. The explanations are very technical and may not be appropriate for a school environment."
"It seems sophisticated. It speaks pleasantly. "
"The robot speaks very clearly and moves in accordance to what it is saying on the chess board."
"It is very cool to see that it moves as it explains. For example explaining how it needs to go to teh four corners to claculate the chess board size. Its movements are also very nice, how it twists its head as it is looking at the chess board (very human like). However, I felt like the explanation was a bot short and lacked depth. It also was more of a robotic voice, perhaps this is just me yet after a while of listening to such a voice most students may become disinterested. "
"It’s thorough in its explanation and could be great for schools as long as it doesn’t become too technical and is age appropriate language. "
"High quality. The voice is confluent and not overly 'robotic' which makes the information communication quite approachable. The movements are also quite interesting to watch"
"It seems very advanced."
"Robot seems to be sophisticated, but it if hard to tell. "
"It's pretty good robot, so probably we can use it at school. the positive is, it can be use to teach a technical topics (subject), but there is probably an interaction that is missing. In teaching, interaction is as crucial as the teaching itself"
"The voice didn't need to sound like C3PO."
