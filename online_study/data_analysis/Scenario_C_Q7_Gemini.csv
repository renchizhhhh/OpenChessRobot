67ad0d3c682da1762c4a55f4,"I do believe that within the next 10 years robots such as the one in the video could be a great replacement for other forms of entertainment such as television or social media because it would draw attention to its consumers due to it being a new creation. It would also be a great replacement because instead of just consuming people's attention, it could teach people while entertaining.",positive
66a521b93899f43f84edab93,"I do not think so because it is too boring.",negative
67acba85ff7cef57e13f46b5,"maybe if you are already into playing games but i dont think tv watchers are playing chess instead, not really the same way to spend free time",neutral
67acfb33ae01aef26d0c309a,"Yes I think so, it is already common for robots to preform human's jobs. In 10 years it will only be more advanced.",positive
67606cf8f87fd914cb80d7c9,"yes, because our society desires more hands-on forms of automated entertainment.",positive
665f5d89f194e7b4dddd91a7,"I don't think so because shows/movies have many elements tied into it and don't employ just 1 element of entertainment for us at a time. It wouldn't be enough to capture our attention and take away tv/",negative
654c1c56d6753c97aee29f70,"Not entirely, it might be able to play games or talk to you but it's not passive like television. Sometimes you just want to sit and not think.",negative

67acfb85581419b36a2f75bf,"yes and no, depending on the person and visual concept.",neutral
5f2bf7aa253520000bfc83b6,"probably because they will outweigh humans and the way humans do things. make it more challenging for people",negative
610098ade3f5bd73650c747c,"TVs can show things from our imaginations that are not possible or costly. I don't think robots would be able to replace that. Robots would be a different form of entertainment.",negative

6736aaf79268c6121b012a63,"I do not think this is possible because we are visual people. While robots could enrich this experience, it can't completely replace it. Not unless, VR capabilities were incorporated in someway.",negative
675721b20cd2fc6af1f48894,"Probably - because entertainment industry is very board and has alot of section and sub-section it's goig to take more than 10yrs to beat that",negative
5ea6edd2aa2fbb07ef2a7b02,"I don’t think it will replace the television it won’t be able to provide the same service but it likely will be used for people who may feel lonely",negative
67abb56a4e67e2f2e2748331,"Yes as it can entertain.",positive
67658271d2aeef7fd8b190c9,"Not really because some people like to watch screens.",negative

5fe23b5e1f2ef9db2ab8e5a0,"It can be an alternate form of entertainment, but not a replacement for TV. I think they serve different use cases.",negative
599f17cb8d2b1600011b3dd3,"yes probably but not  in that same was as its not entertaining enough",neutral
5c20cca1c32e5d0001b944f2,"Yes I think they provide could. I think as technology progresses people want to stay up to date. I'm not sure how it would work for me though",neutral
6043a1dc4c33ef37c64f0812,"In part yes but I think it would need to be incorporated with it as people would miss tv too much I feel as a form of entertainment",neutral
60080f67b339b627a9b7c69e,"No, I think humans still need visual stimulation and we’ve gone beyond being entertained by real life.",negative

672a25ca48271d5ef24c9565,"Yes, since they are more hands on and functional entertainment.",positive
67aa9719f69f4091b9adfb7d,"No, because this robot is quite interactive, and screen-based forms of entertainment will never be replaced.",negative
666bf1b39a86d62453090531,"Maybe not a replace for television which is quite one dimensional, anyway. But surely as a replacement for computer games and other forms of interactive content / media",neutral

5eb85799cc3ea50a5f3591ad,"yes robots can do so much already and have replaced a lot of jobs",positive
5ea93477a5e7d9000ac40a8d,"Possibly as an adjunct. I think screen based forms will stay for quite awhile.",neutral
6775e57b1eeaeb82be47f3fa,"I think there will be a market for it but I think many people just prefer passive entertainment in their downtime.",neutral
66bcb857760c37512c49b0f7,"No. There is no entertainment value in watching the robot. The movement and sound of the robot distracts from the narrative.",negative
63d79eee3050f200940fd28d,"I think they are more suited to mechanise activities rather than for entertainment. Television presents proper people, moving and talking, presenting stories. Robots just move.",negative

5c05e8394c14cf00019dac1a,"I think there is a good possibility.  Real world interaction will always be stronger than simply a screen.",positive
603558a543425a0e08212600,"No, it’s just so different from screen based entertainment it does not have the range to replicate what happens on tv. Tv has the capacity to portray so many character and situation.",negative
5ab10212fb22320001bacdfe,"I don't think it will replace those things, but it could definitely help or be a complementary form of entertainment. But it comes down to ease of access and what you can actually do with it. We thought VR was going to become a big thing but that seems quite niche due to the prices of headsets.  If this kind of robot can only handle chess/board games it will only ever have a very small niche.  Also, at the end of the day you really can't beat watching a film/playing a video game.",negative
60267f9883e25930ddac4e5c,"potentially. it depends where the development of screen technology gets, especially due to recent developments in wearable tech in the past few years.",neutral

66c573ef958593d5c69b5a66,"No, certainly not television as they occupy different niches and this robot would likely not be able to play out a complex social storyline like one might see in a show. But I could see this taking the place of apps or online games like chess.com in many ways.",neutral
658ebe7a218a41f0557845f9,"Yes if their size and form is more sophisticated. Also, this firm of entertainment seems more enjoyable than a PlayStation or X box",positive
5be9e07b887ea400012b46e6,"I don't think they would replace TV's, since TV programs are varied and set in realistic locations etc. Having a robot to talk to or be a companion wouldn't be equivalent to what TV or screens offer.",negative
5483702ffdf99b24c654b810,"Not a replacement, but if I was learning to play chess, I'd rather do it with something like this than at a PC",neutral
6788228f3fcc7c8b75b77522,"Yes because it would allow for people to get a different form of entertainment",positive
63d7e13ef428005671c14564,"I think it would be cool to play against people online using a physical board where the pieces are moved by the robot",neutral
63f63c3f18d751963e6dd151,"I don’t think they would be used as entertainment, unless it’s opponent was human. It wouldn’t be very entertaining and would have a certain winner if programmed to do so ",negative
6447b9633f4b280aad385306,"Definitely, with some work and improvements, robots could be a form of entertainment. As they rely on AI or connected to the internet, they have a wealth of information it could tap into, so there is a wider variety of ways to entertain the user based on the user's specific interests.",positive
5dc416f7f7bfb12dbfd7c1e6,"Possibly not because with screen based entertainment there is more variety where as this does one thing.",negative
667be9702547859d64886b5f,"yeah absolutely but they need to be made more human",positive
5d76ae9afa583b001a6d93e1,"No I believe they will not replace conventional entertainment as I dont think they serve very good visual stimuli and the audio arent very interesting.",negative
664dc1571d9e0a2e6a6c6077,"No- nothing can replace the real entertainment of television ",negative
652b3c9599d7dea192d61fa7,"I think they can, they are already doing so much. they can act as one device with all forms of entertainment and screen and let fo the use of remote to operate. ",positive
60fed34dbf45cd5946139a8e,"no it’s clunky and large and would be too expensive",negative
677406ac2c488f0e35bd8227,"Robots might add new, immersive experiences, but they’re unlikely to fully replace the simplicity and mass appeal of screen-based content",negative
649e1386005223cdaee026de,"Yes I think robots will eventually replace entertainment because technology is advancing rapidly.",positive
6655f13e04490671e36a8dcf,"I can see it happening but I don’t think it will fully replace current entertainment as it is more accessible the way it is now.",neutral
6605b86838c8ba1440cd547c,"I think in some cases for sure, in this case it makes the user feel like he is playing against a real life opponent",neutral
6658b578aab263fcab6c8edb,"No, people need to watch real people on the screen, not robots, we are as humans not ready for this kind of change yet",negative

6774c2e53dd01924f42048f0,"Don’t think so, a screen is far more flexible.",negative
667c1c9b8dca53d1ae8845dc,"Perhaps, it all depends on the experience. If touch was a factor then someone would be able to feel they would interacting more realistically with another person etc. ",neutral
665403f33b8b863a20aa2cd8,"No, as screens no matter a TV or phone will always be a thing and they are always improving.",negative
60ffa8465bb17820efd3374c,"No, I think there is room for both things. People will always love sitting and watching tv. But this would be a different form of entertainment ",neutral
5cd86ddb9b427c00012aff0d,"There might be scope for a robot providing entertainment but watching films and tv are passive activities and a robot would be more useful in interactive situations.",neutral
650624fe967e3e2546ffc90a,"No I don't, people desire to watch other people and have since the days of Shakespeare and the stage. Although i believe it would still be an interesting novelty instead of a replacement. ",negative
662bfda7bb2d2c60655f3c40,"yes, unfortunately.  I think in 10 yrs robots will be everywhere",negative
59d44f0a078dbe00019511a9,"Absolutely not. This robot could be more of an assistance than entertainment.",negative
67704947c5e9d7ffd7f1f8a9,"No, movies and animation will probably still be in high demand, and although this is a cool concept, it can't replicate movies and cinema.",negative
66d9f7cc290fe352941db04f,"No, this is dated technology.",negative
669b2d50545d50125b1ae699,"No, Robots aren't that interesting to watch all day. ",negative
678a8ffcae84cc7fe50f732f,"No. TV takes you to a different reality where your not in your life anymore. It's a version if escapism. You can't get that with robots. You cna have a version of companionship but it won't replace escapism. ",negative
67657be97d52cefdfc7e3ac0,"Definitely with the improvement in innovations in artificial intelligence the 10 years time-span could be shorter",positive
6347339116895d093818bba0,"No, screens will not be replaced",negative

63647b449ebb941211f7db5c,"No. No one wants robots to take over the world. ",negative
573f3168d700ea000ff433a6,"Probably not. People like screens. People like passive. People don't like noisy machinery whirring around.",negative
676097bfcd0214ab4504048b,"Of course, like the created robot above I could have chess matches which would prevent me over-indulging in screen times. Lots of people don't do things because they are alone (ie have a chess partner), so this would change that.",positive
5f29eff59714081a3594a331,"Maybe. If AI is incorporated",neutral
6766fb11828cf789045ce1f8,"No it's not the same at all. Listening to the robot is sort of entertaining, but it's nothing like the sensory experience of watching a TV show, following its characters, taking in the settings and the objects on screen.",negative
611f71c6d905be299168eb4f,"I believe they could undertake certain tasks but couldn't fully replace human conversation ",negative
5e54082eb6e7cd414d4eae0e,"I don't think they would replace a screen for movies totally no. They could be used for entertainment though without doubt",neutral
603a5411c6dd23627f6d6b55,"I don't believe so. The robot's abilities appear finite and most people would be get bored soon after, whereas entertainment is comparatively limitless on screens.",negative

5aeb48c423fdd50001d097dc,"Yes I do, as artificial intelligence is improving daily and I do think it will be a huge part of our lives in the future.",positive
6480794a68d6daa6abd777e1,"I don't think that this would replace human entertainment",negative
60ee1474e6467957994ce2ff,"I don't think so as this is not as multi-use as a computer.",negative
67758bcd4119f910d3272504,"I think so because at this point , it allows you to prompt it and give instructions to it , which it gives you the response you probably want. It might get to the point of reminding you on alarms and the movies and channel that might be useful to you ",positive
67701ee3533fa1cf9818ae85,"I don’t thinks so, because robots still rely humans for working they are not fully autonomous and I don’t think they will ",negative
62e94b6406efad3412531a70,"Probably not, because people will want to watch TV for entertainment purposes, which robots are unable to act out full scenes etc.",negative
5ddd2eda9ca8a3c9af4a5237,"It definitely could because people already use other things that are more accessible/portable than TV such as smartphones, laptops, or other handheld devices",positive
651b02c3dd9a42e8619b2785,"Maybe but it would be cost and functionality limited ",neutral
6740c9ef985ba328ea9ba445,"yes because the world will be running romoely",positive

6777cd52fe65fb187a8e4558,"I do not think robots will replace all scree-based entertainment. Movies and tv programs would still be including real people and robots cannot replace that. Perhaps some forms of entertainment can include robots more, i.e. recreational sports, console games.",negative

6760531b2943898e076153fc,"Not a replacement but something that would serve as a form of entertainment alongside things like televisions",neutral
5de3b3221a7af83b98de0430,"It could but it needs a lot more work. TV is too addictive for everyone including pets and social media is even more addictive.  Find a replacement for those and you are rich for lifetimes.  ",neutral
676aa8c77ae361d05e202994,"Yes, i think the more technology advances the more it can become part of our daily lifes. Maybe help engage people, rather than being behind screens. Having an interactive robot could provide so much more entertainment, than mind numbing and unstimulating television shows",positive
674e3d28cbbcc0e6969e497c,"It depends on the situation, I could see this as automated for household chores.",neutral
673d4583cab131c9147ad22e,"I would say so as they are a bit more advanced which could provide better entertainment.",positive
6773be8d69dba9ebba4102f4,"No, they have no tone or facial expression",negative
5c43724ab00b3300018f49bf,"No, it is slower, louder, has less utility, and takes up more space than a digital display.",negative
64142367de5cd8dfff2a475d,"i think so robots have already come a long way",positive
67acca7dd8acda790b277414,"yes i think it can be and i think it could use more tweaking to be perfect but its good enough to have in 10 years",positive
66f93cc8e6f967889ef2e4b6,"Yes they will serve as a replacement because of their accuracy and delivery",positive
665a6f7b05463883cf73fe17,"No, absolutely not. Robots like these, and including this, are trained on other people's work, often the screen-based entertainment mentioned. Without that material, it would be significantly more difficult for AI/robots to be trained.",negative
673918cac1da9f53da621209,"I believe robots like this one will serve as a supplement for entertainment, in addition to screen-based forms. It will be very difficult to entirely replace television because it is so embedded in our society and existence. ",neutral

6120cea050e9bce18a162223,"I do not think they could replace other forms of entertainment as I think what they would be able to do both technically and theoretically would not be particularly entertaining. If it is static in a home I cannot see many potential use cases for entertainment.",negative

5fc97909520cd94a49b6b870,"Definitely because more interactive.",positive
66799be9ea1183434ff60ca5,"Not really, the robot is only able to move objects and talk, there is no screen and it is not very entertaining to watch it.",negative
64d8e4e738368be56871e9f4,"No, I don't think this robot like this would be able to replace a TV or tablet in 10 years, I think it would need a lot more tweeks and must have more aesthetically pleasing features. I'm sure it will replace us within another 50 years when technology is better. To be fair, we've only recently got AI automated cars.",negative

5d287be62a33c100167c93c6,"No, I do not believe that within 10 years, robots like this could feasibly become a widespread, accepted replacement of existing screen entertainment. While cool and exciting, it seems much more like a novelty product rather than an everyday replacement. It seems one-note, not capable of doing the multifaceted tasks of our other entertainment devices such as cellphones, computers or frankly even television. I think it is a cool idea, however I see it finding more of a home in places like museums of sorts, communal public spaces or classrooms.",negative

5fbdc4f0784d3f225d8d96d1,"Robots like this would probably not completely replace screen based forms of entertainment in 10 years. A lot more time would be needed for a generational shift in preferences. The robot seems a bit bulky and is less space efficient than screen based technology. It may also still be unaffordable for households.",negative
62714702132c0c53d426c914,"I think it will be , cause people are getting lazy and they want  someone to do work for them ",positive

6601b76d13817c7dc3117d2a,"Yes, I could definitely envisage that for sure. I think TV is going to be less and less important in peoples lives, this is already evident. I think if these robots could retail at a reasonable price they would definitely be an option.",positive

I think there is an uncomfortable factor of being watched or having something that too closely approaches sentience / consciousness just waiting on you like a servant that most people would not enjoy.",negative
66b3ec7190b9531f69e51d87,"Nope. If the last 10 years of technological advancement has taught me anything, it's that people are increasingly engaging with entertainment that requires less and less effort (i.e scrolling on TikTok and watching streaming services). I expect that this kind of robot would be too much effort to setup and maintain for most people and would be reserved for chess enthusiasts only.",negative

5ffd3f5a81fc4f21eaa9ba9f,"I don't think robots could serve as an entire replacement for things such as T.V. as it doesn't necessarily fulfill all the aspects I enjoy about other forms of entertainment. For example, for games, I would enjoy interacting directly with the game and being able to enjoy different forms of different genres of games.

67ace8c5d75a10eef2f8887c,"I don't think robots could serve as a replacement for television because television often has colours, dialogue, and certain parts to it that make it engaging in a way that robots might struggle to replicate. While robots could provide interactive experiences, they may not give the same level of storytelling, emotional depth, or artistry found in movies and TV shows.  ",negative

67608d010ab313f56180df40,"I don't think they will replace screen based forms of entertainment because when you watch tv you switch off and relax and immerse yourself in to a place that's different to where you are. With the robot you have to think and respond to it, which is what people do all day at work. ",negative

The personal and/or aspect of some forms of TV, such as game shows, seems to be extremely important. Although I don’t this  kind of robot will replace TV I would expect it’s popularity to increase over the next 10 years. A parallel example is quiz shows versus online quizzes. Whilst the popularity of the former increases I doubt that it will completely replace person hosted quizzes.",negative
6655d895e8c33b7738009342,"It depends on the level of advancement in robotics and AI. If robots become highly interactive, emotionally intelligent, and capable of adapting entertainment to individual preferences, they could challenge traditional screen-based entertainment.",neutral

669477e9453fd65ed78420eb,"No, it's not nearly as accessible, mass produce-able, or even entertaining. Screen based devices can be made for incredibly cheap and last a long time, a complex robot such as this would cost several hundreds of dollars to produce, even more to buy, and does not have an extensive track record of good functioning. Also, social media's ability to captivate attention can't be understated. People who's attentions are easily swayed will always go to effortless sources of entertainment like Tiktok, and people who try to consume mindfully will usually go less technological forms of entertainment, so outside of a niche audience of mostly rich tech enthusiasts, I don't see anyone being excited about this for entertainment.",negative
