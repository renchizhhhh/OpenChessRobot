R_2JCWG0PB6B7JBl0,Yes it brings the explanation to life when the robot can move and describe its own actions and processes,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_1CKmaJXJxmA2uVw,"I think for some people who are auditory leaners, this could be a great alternative to text based learning. That being said, as people learn in many different ways, I don't personally see robots such as this completely replacing screen based models.",neutral,negative,False,negative,1
R_7PpStFSG5EnF08V,They could because they are so advanced already.,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_2SUyGZQgdtjmB3z,"No, because while the technology is still developing fast, people get sceptical and end of the day, humans develope robots. ",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_5P6xNOoIp9cQ41p,I have no particular input on this issue.,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_8iWi6Q4Vec15PpP,Partly but I don't think they could completely replace screen based computers. They could be an excellent replacement in technical areas. Especially demonstrating physical actions.,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_32kae309HOf4c6t,The words spoken by the robot were concise and  understandable. But words alone would not be an ideal teaching tool - they should be accompanied by some sort of visual aid.,negative,neutral,False,negative,1

R_7M2EkpIw7LDkgQ9,yes because a lot of advancement is coming in the next 10 years.,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_8MT2e1bNofM7BYz,"I'm not entirely sure. I think it would certainly help explain things because of the fact that it can express, through movements, what it's trying to explain. Like how humans use our arms etc to emphasise points. However having a screen can mean showing so much more to help visualise aspects of conversations and topics.",neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_20Nyw7fWaQpObfY,I think it would take longer to adopt such technology in the workplace,negative,neutral,False,negative,1
R_9fejUROz26yL3rg,Sure they can. They are evolving fast and will a more common form of interaction.,positive,positive,True,positive,1

R_2tmJB5CoCE6WMiV,Robots like this could be useful but I’d see this being way more advanced in 10 years so maybe they’d be obsolete.,negative,neutral,False,negative,1
R_8p3vVBfJy0Roc3J,"They will to an extent, however, they will be significantly more expensive ",neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_8FLYQrJHbpeqZSZ,Yes. By interacting with physical objects the robots represent human dynamics more easily and its operations can be more clearly understood.,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_1Oy8bRIzJQR51Fr,They should be able to replace screen-based systems though it is unclear about the cost involved. An 8000-dollar robot doesn't seem as useful as a 30-dollar program,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_30f5U6w60iM93JD,No because that is very complicated,negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_4qyuhOpAv1pDb5I,"I hope not - I think it gets rid of the written words for people to read to understand topics, could be used for kinestic and auditory learners",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_1afQB5m6jBvqgNP,"Not really, this is more expensive than computers, has little value to general personal users ",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_6QDtZGLLsEtrPI5,"NO. I believe that being totally autonomous is against human nature, and humans want to preform tasks themselves to ensure there are no mistakes",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_2IQcXIbbogDw2w0,yes but robots like this can also be used in conjunction with screen-based computers as i think they both have their pros and cons,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_5Iyf6rPzSgWh1VV,Potentially yes as it seems a lot more interactive.,positive,neutral,False,positive,1
R_2OcWZE5dOzmAge2,"I think they can, but not in the time-frame. I think we're 20-30 years away from that",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_1B5nbwHhWv5DQgX,"That thought really scares me. Yes, I do think they will have the capability to replace computers- but at what cost? Are robots going to phase human reliance out of existence? I don't really know a whole heck of a lot about computer vision but I know that the technological advances in robotics is astounding.",positive,neutral,False,neutral,1
R_3OJi71bedx9M6EX,Yes. 10 years is a long time in tech to get all the gimmicks in the right places to make robots feel more real and personal to everyone.,positive,positive,True,positive,1

R_8hEJi55VJjeUtYY,I do not think they could serve as a total replacement. Being able to showcase technologies like computer vision using a robot arm is more of an additional piece of equipment to help make people understand certain technologies in a more physical capacity.,negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_8Y8zZryy3GktQop,"I think certain fields that require physical effort would be good areas to replace screen-based computers, however things that can be demonstrating purely through vision wouldn't be applications for robots like this",neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1

R_7MSfiIjIEKxasoJ,"While robots like this could make learning more interactive, they are unlikely to fully replace screen-based computers in the next 10 years. Computers still offer greater flexibility for complex tasks, but robots can complement education by providing hands-on experience and real-world applications.",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_6oZ1Pr3CVGah1x1,These robotic systems will improve hands-on education but cannot accomplish the complete replacement of screen-based computing technology during the coming decade. The use of computers represents an improved method of teaching advanced computational topics since they deliver flexible teaching approaches at reduced costs with scalable implementation for students.,negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_3GzqGQWzIqpd0Od,"I think it needs to be more fun if you are going to use it to teach kids.  Yes, the robot is cool, but he talks way above their level.",neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_82ijMrop95eDmdU,"Yes, if done correctly this is possible. Actually seeing something in real life making real-life movements makes teaching easier.",positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_8jP7lYMKLjFr3eU,"I'm not sure a robot like this one would replace screen-based computers. Computers seem much more versatile, capable of a wide range of activities related to a wide range of topics - they are more flexible to the changing needs of education, whereas this robot or similar ones seem more limited in their scope.",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_5rqoPufiRLCioNg,Yes because it is interactive and you could ask it questions and it would answer.,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_6BY9LMBt0RUtaRr,"I would not think so.  This robot is just a task oriented robot and could not replace screens.  To illustrate a few tasks that robot could do and why they are doing them is good for this type of robot, but i don't think it is capable of replacing screen based computers",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_5Gp7ANM4bxQFhIY,"In my opinion, it really depends on the costs. If the cost is low then I don't see why this cannot be an alternative. It also depends on how effective it is for students to learn this way.",neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_2usyONwCihXdJtA,Probably not because the screen based computers still will be cheaper version and probably 3d hologram will be more useful than robots for educational purposes,negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_8gqOn0LrTueDJ7h,To teach people how things might get repaired or put back together.,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1

R_21MZDKL60dVHwOg,"It could be a possibility, but some learners might find it more difficult to follow as they might be visual learner and need text to follow. It could work well for a kinaesthetic learner.",neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_8A0yZomS94xeg5I,Yes because visual learning is easier to take in and remember,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_2soGsZ2CGTpI5mB,Depends on the cost mainly. Screen based computers are probably more diverse,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_84jhlDod0FuX33e,"Yes, with further development I believe that this is very likely to be the case as robots will be able to explain well and clearly, including tailoring their language and complexity to people of differing abilities.",positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_8FRL08nVzOOpndM,"Probably not. Seems slightly impractical, I still think a screen will be the dominant form.",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_85zF5gLA2nmc43D,Yes because I think hands on models would be a better teaching aid than screen based ones,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_8C2PvHhW0Gy3CqJ,"Yes, it could save time in terms of the computer booting process",positive,neutral,False,positive,1
R_3EEDZLMPcORClAP,"For some people, especially those who are vision impaired, I can see that being very useful. But in general, I can't imagine people preferring a 3D object like a robot to screens. Part of that is because we haven't replaced books with something 3D.",neutral,negative,False,negative,1
R_21uL6vEDPUtjdB5,Yes. They can offer hands on learning and teaching of technical concepts.,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_8GUsHgw3yA4XSMN,"I think probably not, but they could help enhance learning or more probably help with engagement of certain topics. The reason for not is due to the robot being able to demonstrate one or two specific parts of a topic where a screen can essentially show you anything.",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_7dG3vBQOVnSkfxT,I guess so. The explanation was a little technical and it didn't really use any visual aids in exaining how it works. I think a screen based explanation could use more visuals in the explanation to make it clearer.,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_3QflQlhJ7fJfD74,maybe i am not sure if it is practical,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_2EhweLRd4IORk6F,This could help in a future. The question would be how much interaction you could have with the robot to ask question and explain wording and actions. If it is possibly then this could easier flowing passage of information. Intelligence and response of the robot would be crucial. As well as adapting the style when needed.,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_7r0yGOQ2nG4M70O,"Potentially, depending on the advancement of robots.  I think robots can be used to teach some technical topics, but not others.  Something like playing chess makes sense, but other more serious topics may not be appropriate.",neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_4zJ7kSgnnoiiKHo,Yes they could - BUT might be that screen or VR based alternatives will be more appropriate and lower cost?,neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_5CTxJ7lK5m4TSCf,"I think so. While this robot's explanation could be more comprehensive, it does a good job at clearly expressing what it does.",positive,neutral,False,positive,1
R_21CFjSyds5QELJf,"Not sure, I think in 10 years things will be more advanced than that",neutral,neutral,True,neutral,1
R_7JoZ4e1s8IMTNct,"Yes, and there could also be humanoid robots that mimic teachers which would make it seem more natural",positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_8FcfIDJVjVFXcHv,Yes as technology has been advancing very quickly,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_816w9UU1DaYvFvZ,yes i think so because AI will become more intelligent. it already is very intelligent but will become more advanced and provide more services in line with what humans do now,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_2oLoY7vaK8byc18,Yes it could because this helps with the learning since in person and not on a screen,positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_92Pcmt4dIdg755V,"I am not 100% sure, but I think they could replace screen based computers or at the very least augment them. The reason being that they would be able to physically show what the robot is doing and at the same time as it is doing it. I thing using robots also can have the appearance of being more interactive as it exists in the physical world, also robots are just cool.  ",positive,neutral,False,positive,1
R_4ig3zQOFkrpyJYS,"Yes, it is possible for robots to do such - if people can adapt and get used to such a shift. Not all humans may embrace such a change, even if technologically it is feasible and well more efficient.",positive,neutral,False,positive,1
R_25HhHDP3QnMa57l,"Robots may enhance but won’t fully replace screens in 10 years; cost, computing power, and adaptability still favor traditional computers.",negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_8kFl04aReBVyTP5,I think in regards to replacing computer vision I feel that it most likely will not be replaced as far as I am aware that it would be highly costly and it would require much more advanced infrastructure. Thus the benefits would out weight the costs and it was not be effective.,negative,negative,True,negative,1
R_8XbtBvFchV4wtfw,"Yes, this is because we are in a technology age and things are changing rapidly.",positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_6k6V6DAJH6QrD3e,"I am not very knowledgeable on this but I believe that technologies like that develops rapidly and allows replacement of many different tools with the same or better functionality. So, yes I think it can serve as a replacement.",positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_2couDPIJotRn2kV,"Yes, only because there are a lot of health hazards to spending time on Computer screens in comparison to robots like this.",positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_30AEgkmSBG77RTw,"Yes  think it could and I think this robot demonstrates it well. I also think having something move, versus just watching something on a screen is more appealing, and would lead to more visual learning.",positive,positive,True,positive,1
R_61BXwLNApcZKBsl,"Yes. This is a better demonstration than an on screen computer as it shows firsthand how computer vision happens, and explains while doing so through the speaker.",positive,positive,True,positive,1

R_8JIXPiwrTAf4ava,"Why Robots Could Gain Popularity 	1.	Tactile and Physical Engagement ? Many players prefer physical chessboards over digital screens. A robot that moves pieces and provides real-time coaching could offer a more immersive experience. 	2.	Better for Young Learners ? Interactive robots could help children stay engaged and reduce screen time while learning chess. 	3.	AI and Adaptive Learning ? Future robots will likely have stronger AI with personalized coaching, similar to Chess.com or Lichess, but in a real-world setting. 	4.	Classroom and Group Use ? Robots could be useful for schools and chess clubs where multiple students can observe and interact without needing individual devices.  Why Screens Won?t Be Fully Replaced 	1.	Versatility of Screens ? Chess apps allow for online play, advanced analysis, and access to massive databases of games, which a robot may struggle to replicate. 	2.	Cost and Accessibility ? High-quality chess robots with AI coaching would be expensive, whereas chess software on a tablet or PC is widely accessible. 	3.	Portability and Convenience ? A chess app on a phone or laptop is more convenient for learning and playing anywhere, unlike a physical robot. 	",neutral,neutral,True,neutral,2
