Q7_Response,Category
"perhaps. probably not though, because of cost and too many are too lazy to be bothered.",negative
"I do believe that within the next 10 years robots such as the one in the video could be a great replacement for other forms of entertainment such as television or social media because it would draw attention to its consumers due to it being a new creation. It would also be a great replacement because instead of just consuming people's attention, it could teach people while entertaining.",positive
I do not think so because it is too boring.,negative
"maybe if you are already into playing games but i dont think tv watchers are playing chess instead, not really the same way to spend free time",neutral
"Yes I think so, it is already common for robots to preform human's jobs. In 10 years it will only be more advanced.",positive
"yes, because our society desires more hands-on forms of automated entertainment.",positive
I don't think so because shows/movies have many elements tied into it and don't employ just 1 element of entertainment for us at a time. It wouldn't be enough to capture our attention and take away tv/,negative
"Not entirely, it might be able to play games or talk to you but it's not passive like television. Sometimes you just want to sit and not think.",negative
no. people want aspirational characters and robots are not,negative
I do not think we are there yet with artificial intelligence in the next 10 years.,negative
"yes and no, depending on the person and visual concept.",neutral
probably because they will outweigh humans and the way humans do things. make it more challenging for people,negative
TVs can show things from our imaginations that are not possible or costly. I don't think robots would be able to replace that. Robots would be a different form of entertainment.,negative
Possibly in 10 years robots will be better part of our life’s.,neutral
"I do not think this is possible because we are visual people. While robots could enrich this experience, it can't completely replace it. Not unless, VR capabilities were incorporated in someway.",negative
Probably - because entertainment industry is very board and has alot of section and sub-section it's goig to take more than 10yrs to beat that,negative
I don’t think it will replace the television it won’t be able to provide the same service but it likely will be used for people who may feel lonely,negative
Yes as it can entertain.,positive
Not really because some people like to watch screens.,negative
No. It8s too big and bulky when you could just play on your phone.,negative
"It can be an alternate form of entertainment, but not a replacement for TV. I think they serve different use cases.",negative
yes probably but not  in that same was as its not entertaining enough,neutral
Yes I think they provide could. I think as technology progresses people want to stay up to date. I'm not sure how it would work for me though,neutral
In part yes but I think it would need to be incorporated with it as people would miss tv too much I feel as a form of entertainment,neutral
"No, I think humans still need visual stimulation and we’ve gone beyond being entertained by real life.",negative
I dont think the robot is the same as a television but I can see it becoming its own form of entertaininment,neutral
"NO, I feel they could be useful, but I don't find it entertaining.",negative
"I don't know - I think that there will always be a space for tv's, tv shows etc",neutral
I can't imagine wanting that kind of future and I don't know what it would look like,negative
"Yes, since they are more hands on and functional entertainment.",positive
"No, because this robot is quite interactive, and screen-based forms of entertainment will never be replaced.",negative
"Maybe not a replace for television which is quite one dimensional, anyway. But surely as a replacement for computer games and other forms of interactive content / media",neutral
sure. robots are every where,neutral
yes robots can do so much already and have replaced a lot of jobs,positive
Possibly as an adjunct. I think screen based forms will stay for quite awhile.,neutral
I think there will be a market for it but I think many people just prefer passive entertainment in their downtime.,neutral
No. There is no entertainment value in watching the robot. The movement and sound of the robot distracts from the narrative.,negative
"I think they are more suited to mechanise activities rather than for entertainment. Television presents proper people, moving and talking, presenting stories. Robots just move.",negative
It might replace the existing screen in future,neutral
I think there is a good possibility.  Real world interaction will always be stronger than simply a screen.,positive
"No, it’s just so different from screen based entertainment it does not have the range to replicate what happens on tv. Tv has the capacity to portray so many character and situation.",negative
"I don't think it will replace those things, but it could definitely help or be a complementary form of entertainment. But it comes down to ease of access and what you can actually do with it. We thought VR was going to become a big thing but that seems quite niche due to the prices of headsets.  If this kind of robot can only handle chess/board games it will only ever have a very small niche.  Also, at the end of the day you really can't beat watching a film/playing a video game.",negative
"potentially. it depends where the development of screen technology gets, especially due to recent developments in wearable tech in the past few years.",neutral
"No, I don't believe so. I think the likes of AR will be the prominent entertainment form in the coming decades.",negative
Potentially but I think there would need to be improvements with the technology to keep up with the progress in 10 years,neutral
"No, certainly not television as they occupy different niches and this robot would likely not be able to play out a complex social storyline like one might see in a show. But I could see this taking the place of apps or online games like chess.com in many ways.",neutral
"Yes if their size and form is more sophisticated. Also, this firm of entertainment seems more enjoyable than a PlayStation or X box",positive
"I don't think they would replace TV's, since TV programs are varied and set in realistic locations etc. Having a robot to talk to or be a companion wouldn't be equivalent to what TV or screens offer.",negative
"Not a replacement, but if I was learning to play chess, I'd rather do it with something like this than at a PC",neutral
Yes because it would allow for people to get a different form of entertainment,positive
I think it would be cool to play against people online using a physical board where the pieces are moved by the robot,neutral
"I don’t think they would be used as entertainment, unless it’s opponent was human. It wouldn’t be very entertaining and would have a certain winner if programmed to do so ",negative
"Definitely, with some work and improvements, robots could be a form of entertainment. As they rely on AI or connected to the internet, they have a wealth of information it could tap into, so there is a wider variety of ways to entertain the user based on the user's specific interests.",positive
Possibly not because with screen based entertainment there is more variety where as this does one thing.,negative
yeah absolutely but they need to be made more human,positive
No I believe they will not replace conventional entertainment as I dont think they serve very good visual stimuli and the audio arent very interesting.,negative
No- nothing can replace the real entertainment of television ,negative
"I think they can, they are already doing so much. they can act as one device with all forms of entertainment and screen and let fo the use of remote to operate. ",positive
no it’s clunky and large and would be too expensive,negative
"Robots might add new, immersive experiences, but they’re unlikely to fully replace the simplicity and mass appeal of screen-based content",negative
Yes I think robots will eventually replace entertainment because technology is advancing rapidly.,positive
I can see it happening but I don’t think it will fully replace current entertainment as it is more accessible the way it is now.,neutral
"I think in some cases for sure, in this case it makes the user feel like he is playing against a real life opponent",neutral
"No, people need to watch real people on the screen, not robots, we are as humans not ready for this kind of change yet",negative
i dont think so. maybe i just dont have a good imagination but i cant understand what for. ,negative
"Don’t think so, a screen is far more flexible.",negative
"Perhaps, it all depends on the experience. If touch was a factor then someone would be able to feel they would interacting more realistically with another person etc. ",neutral
"No, as screens no matter a TV or phone will always be a thing and they are always improving.",negative
"No, I think there is room for both things. People will always love sitting and watching tv. But this would be a different form of entertainment ",neutral
There might be scope for a robot providing entertainment but watching films and tv are passive activities and a robot would be more useful in interactive situations.,neutral
"No I don't, people desire to watch other people and have since the days of Shakespeare and the stage. Although i believe it would still be an interesting novelty instead of a replacement. ",negative
"yes, unfortunately.  I think in 10 yrs robots will be everywhere",negative
Absolutely not. This robot could be more of an assistance than entertainment.,negative
"No, movies and animation will probably still be in high demand, and although this is a cool concept, it can't replicate movies and cinema.",negative
"No, this is dated technology.",negative
"No, Robots aren't that interesting to watch all day. ",negative
No. TV takes you to a different reality where your not in your life anymore. It's a version if escapism. You can't get that with robots. You cna have a version of companionship but it won't replace escapism. ,negative
Definitely with the improvement in innovations in artificial intelligence the 10 years time-span could be shorter,positive
"No, screens will not be replaced",negative
"With required laws and scrutinising in place, AI based robots can be part of teaching skills, games and entertainment. ",neutral
No. No one wants robots to take over the world. ,negative
Probably not. People like screens. People like passive. People don't like noisy machinery whirring around.,negative
"Of course, like the created robot above I could have chess matches which would prevent me over-indulging in screen times. Lots of people don't do things because they are alone (ie have a chess partner), so this would change that.",positive
Maybe. If AI is incorporated,neutral
"No it's not the same at all. Listening to the robot is sort of entertaining, but it's nothing like the sensory experience of watching a TV show, following its characters, taking in the settings and the objects on screen.",negative
I believe they could undertake certain tasks but couldn't fully replace human conversation ,negative
I don't think they would replace a screen for movies totally no. They could be used for entertainment though without doubt,neutral
"I don't believe so. The robot's abilities appear finite and most people would be get bored soon after, whereas entertainment is comparatively limitless on screens.",negative
"No, television is a different sort of entertainment and couldn’t be replaced in this way",negative
"Yes I do, as artificial intelligence is improving daily and I do think it will be a huge part of our lives in the future.",positive
I don't think that this would replace human entertainment,negative
I don't think so as this is not as multi-use as a computer.,negative
"I think so because at this point , it allows you to prompt it and give instructions to it , which it gives you the response you probably want. It might get to the point of reminding you on alarms and the movies and channel that might be useful to you ",positive
"I don’t thinks so, because robots still rely humans for working they are not fully autonomous and I don’t think they will ",negative
"Probably not, because people will want to watch TV for entertainment purposes, which robots are unable to act out full scenes etc.",negative
"It definitely could because people already use other things that are more accessible/portable than TV such as smartphones, laptops, or other handheld devices",positive
Maybe but it would be cost and functionality limited ,neutral
yes because the world will be running romoely,positive
I think they could but they still don't feel as relatable as a real human would,neutral
"I do not think robots will replace all scree-based entertainment. Movies and tv programs would still be including real people and robots cannot replace that. Perhaps some forms of entertainment can include robots more, i.e. recreational sports, console games.",negative
"I dont think so, maybe for a specific type of people but I personally did not find this interesting and would still much rather watch the movie on a screen, ",negative
I think this sort of entertainment would be more engaging but people also want more passive entertainment over longer periods ,neutral
"I think they could, but tv is way bigger than this",neutral
I dont think so; I dont think there have been enough improvements on the vocal and personality aspects of robots....yet,negative
Not a replacement but something that would serve as a form of entertainment alongside things like televisions,neutral
It could but it needs a lot more work. TV is too addictive for everyone including pets and social media is even more addictive.  Find a replacement for those and you are rich for lifetimes.  ,neutral
"Yes, i think the more technology advances the more it can become part of our daily lifes. Maybe help engage people, rather than being behind screens. Having an interactive robot could provide so much more entertainment, than mind numbing and unstimulating television shows",positive
"It depends on the situation, I could see this as automated for household chores.",neutral
I would say so as they are a bit more advanced which could provide better entertainment.,positive
"No, they have no tone or facial expression",negative
"No, it is slower, louder, has less utility, and takes up more space than a digital display.",negative
i think so robots have already come a long way,positive
yes i think it can be and i think it could use more tweaking to be perfect but its good enough to have in 10 years,positive
Yes they will serve as a replacement because of their accuracy and delivery,positive
"No, absolutely not. Robots like these, and including this, are trained on other people's work, often the screen-based entertainment mentioned. Without that material, it would be significantly more difficult for AI/robots to be trained.",negative
"I believe robots like this one will serve as a supplement for entertainment, in addition to screen-based forms. It will be very difficult to entirely replace television because it is so embedded in our society and existence. ",neutral
"No, I think that people prefer visual entertainment. ",negative
What's the point in playing chess with a robot when you could just play online with an AI on or a human on Chess.com?,negative
I’m not sure but if they used it in a positive way with learning tools it would be more beneficial to society ,neutral
I do not think they could replace other forms of entertainment as I think what they would be able to do both technically and theoretically would not be particularly entertaining. If it is static in a home I cannot see many potential use cases for entertainment.,negative
"i dont think so , i dont think that tv will ever be replaced by robots . tv has been around too long and as a race it is inbuilt in us to watch ",negative
No. I feel like tv is just easy and provides enough entertainment. ,negative
No. There is too high a cost and people would get bored with the robots. TV has a lot more to offer and is much easier to use.,negative
I don’t think so. They’re large and bulky. They aren’t portable. ,negative
"Probably not, unless they incorporated a screen into the robot perhaps? ",neutral
Definitely because more interactive.,positive
"Not really, the robot is only able to move objects and talk, there is no screen and it is not very entertaining to watch it.",negative
"No, I don't think this robot like this would be able to replace a TV or tablet in 10 years, I think it would need a lot more tweeks and must have more aesthetically pleasing features. I'm sure it will replace us within another 50 years when technology is better. To be fair, we've only recently got AI automated cars.",negative
Hmmm I don't think so. Tv will always be around,negative
"No, I do not believe that within 10 years, robots like this could feasibly become a widespread, accepted replacement of existing screen entertainment. While cool and exciting, it seems much more like a novelty product rather than an everyday replacement. It seems one-note, not capable of doing the multifaceted tasks of our other entertainment devices such as cellphones, computers or frankly even television. I think it is a cool idea, however I see it finding more of a home in places like museums of sorts, communal public spaces or classrooms.",negative
possibly depending how it is implemented if it can be used with various things it could offer a more personalised home entertainment experience eventually,neutral
Robots like this would probably not completely replace screen based forms of entertainment in 10 years. A lot more time would be needed for a generational shift in preferences. The robot seems a bit bulky and is less space efficient than screen based technology. It may also still be unaffordable for households.,negative
"I think it will be , cause people are getting lazy and they want  someone to do work for them ",positive
"No probably not, as they take up too much room ",negative
"Yes, robots can be used for entertainment but not sure that they will replace television, will expect people will still want to watch movies and series and or other programs",neutral
"I don't think the robots could replace existing forms of entertainment as they would ultimately not be able to provide the emotional connection/be interesting enough to entertain people the same way movies/tv does, I think most people find robots like these a fun novelty for a small amount of time but quickly move on.",negative
"Hopefully not, it's not exactly entertaining to watch. It's just creepy.",negative
It's a gimmick.  You can't watch cricket or a movie on a robot.,negative
"Yes, I could definitely envisage that for sure. I think TV is going to be less and less important in peoples lives, this is already evident. I think if these robots could retail at a reasonable price they would definitely be an option.",positive
I don’t think so - I think it’s function is quite limited and don’t think it could reasonably replace existing forms of entertainment ,negative
"No, since people enjoy passive forms of entertainment like watching something on a screen, not just more active forms like video games or board games. I think there is an uncomfortable factor of being watched or having something that too closely approaches sentience / consciousness just waiting on you like a servant that most people would not enjoy.",negative
"Nope. If the last 10 years of technological advancement has taught me anything, it's that people are increasingly engaging with entertainment that requires less and less effort (i.e scrolling on TikTok and watching streaming services). I expect that this kind of robot would be too much effort to setup and maintain for most people and would be reserved for chess enthusiasts only.",negative
I hope not. Humans are still the artists in this universe and it would be such a shame if our entertainment will be in the hands of robots.,negative
"Not for me , I would rather watch humans in shows films etc than  artificial AI",negative
I don't think so. Robots are a very niche market in terms of human interaction. ,negative
Yes I probably do. Heaven knows what kind of Tech already exists and will certainly exist in the near future. Frightening really (for me anyway),neutral
"i believe it could, interaction based can be more friendly and also reduces addiction to screen",positive
"No, too expensive and not useful",negative
No. It requires more space and energy.,negative
"I don't think robots could serve as an entire replacement for things such as T.V. as it doesn't necessarily fulfill all the aspects I enjoy about other forms of entertainment. For example, for games, I would enjoy interacting directly with the game and being able to enjoy different forms of different genres of games. For T.V., a robot wouldn't be able to replicate the drama or showwriting of a particular T.V. show or feature actors I enjoy. Therefore, I don't think robots could serve as replacements because they are completely different forms of technology in themselves.",negative
I would say probably not as no matter how good robots are designed and made they are still slow in movement and TV has so much variety at the touch of a button.,negative
"I don't think robots could serve as a replacement for television because television often has colours, dialogue, and certain parts to it that make it engaging in a way that robots might struggle to replicate. While robots could provide interactive experiences, they may not give the same level of storytelling, emotional depth, or artistry found in movies and TV shows.  ",negative
"Maybe for certain people. I don’t think it could replace watching human drama, action, romance or comedy shows for the majority of people who enjoy those things",negative
"no, not entirely. The robot should be far more advanced and have a human designed body",negative
Probably not as it is not interactive enough for most people at this stage.,negative
No i don't think robots are entertaining in the same way as a television,negative
Yes. I think improvements in screen based entertainment are trying to bring a more immersive experience by making it as real as possible. Robots provide the opportunity to make significant aspects actually real.,positive
"while i do believe they have a place in entertainment in the future, television and the comforts that come with it are still key to the human experience, I see robots in a more auxiliary role for entertainment.",neutral
"I don't think they will replace screen based forms of entertainment because when you watch tv you switch off and relax and immerse yourself in to a place that's different to where you are. With the robot you have to think and respond to it, which is what people do all day at work. ",negative
"I don’t think so, humans crave human interactions.  I also think we are too hooked to technology now, so much so that we will get bored.",negative
yes. Content could be far more tailored to a person's individual tastes,positive
I don’t think they would replace things like tvs or gaming consoles as people like to mindlessly relax with these forms of entertainment. I do think they could exist alongside however depending on price .people that maybe lonely may benefit particularly if they looked less mechanical ie someone to play chess with if you live alone .,neutral
"no, technology not there",negative
no because it would lack the visual representation that tv allows,negative
"potentially, but i don’t see these robots replacing the creativity of real people. ",negative
"I would hope not, but I do think they provide entertainment for many people. ",negative
"I really don’t think having a robot play chess would serve as a television replacement firstly robots as chess players will eliminate the human experience of playing chess, whereas television is mainly for visual entertainment robots cannot replace the viewing pleasure from televisions ",negative
Probably not because a lot of people use social media and enjoy seeing other people online.,negative
"I doubt that this kind of robot would replace entertainment such as TV. It is not as visually stimulating as TV. The personal and/or aspect of some forms of TV, such as game shows, seems to be extremely important. Although I don’t this  kind of robot will replace TV I would expect it’s popularity to increase over the next 10 years. A parallel example is quiz shows versus online quizzes. Whilst the popularity of the former increases I doubt that it will completely replace person hosted quizzes.",negative
"It depends on the level of advancement in robotics and AI. If robots become highly interactive, emotionally intelligent, and capable of adapting entertainment to individual preferences, they could challenge traditional screen-based entertainment.",neutral
I don't think they would be a replacement but they would probably add to the entertainment as an extra. The television shows much more visual things which the robot cannot provide. ,negative
"No, it's not nearly as accessible, mass produce-able, or even entertaining. Screen based devices can be made for incredibly cheap and last a long time, a complex robot such as this would cost several hundreds of dollars to produce, even more to buy, and does not have an extensive track record of good functioning. Also, social media's ability to captivate attention can't be understated. People who's attentions are easily swayed will always go to effortless sources of entertainment like Tiktok, and people who try to consume mindfully will usually go less technological forms of entertainment, so outside of a niche audience of mostly rich tech enthusiasts, I don't see anyone being excited about this for entertainment.",negative
maybe but it will depend on the end-user preferences,neutral
Yes because they are intriguing and intelligent or have a multitude of knowledge ,positive
i don't think a robot can replace a television. watching shows and interacting with an ai is two different kind of entertainment. the only way that this robot can replace a television is if he would have an integrated screen playing our favorite shows,negative
"Not really in my opinion, but they can perform some entertainment and also complement humans. Screen  based form of entertainment can provide a variety of entertainment as compared to robots which can only a few.",neutral
"Yes , they will take over lots of jobs and they will be hopeless and Holmes",positive
"no, because anything this robot can do can be achieved by playing chess with a computer online",negative
No don't think so the human aspect is missing,negative
No. People are to lazy. They like the passive forms of entertainment to much. ,negative
"Robots provide hands-on experiences, making them more immersive and mentally stimulating; unlike the TV",positive
"I don't think so, I believe they could definitely have a place, for playing games with children and adults but in the current form I think it would become a bit boring.",neutral
Maybe. I don't think they replace tv but they might be an interesting accompaniment,neutral
"It depends on how screen entertainment progresses, robots could help create an ability to play 2 player games such as chess or darts where you need to play against someone",neutral
I don't think it would replace them but can be alongside them as a different form of entertainment that people could enjoy.,neutral
I don't because kids just love the games console ,negative
"No, television is here to stay. The quality of picture is always improving and everyone's home. Unlike robots. Not everyone is interested in using, especially elderly and boomers. ",negative
No I don't think so. Perhaps the robot could help entertain elderly disabled and teach them things.,negative
Totally not. It's just a less efficient way to analyze/play a game than a computer screen could provide.,negative
"No, more human interaction is preferred.",negative
"Yes robots like this could very likely be a replacement, for something like tablets etc, ... small screen devices. I think larger screen devices like tv screens wouldn't work so well. ",neutral
