"R_5J8uHvrhM4sRIjL","The robot is incredible ","2"
"R_7EbCXnJ4ZDFVQc9","Clearly communicates why a move should be used, the benefits of the chess move, and gives some background context on why the move is used (e.g., ""[E4] is one of the most popular and aggressive moves for White"" and ""opening lines for my Queen and Bishop"")","2"
"R_80Deztc9VK2oTCx","It moves accurately and swiftly.","2"
"R_33SUIxyiGzpmoxP","The positive aspect of this robot are that you know the information that is programmed will be taught. However, on the negative side, there is no one on one communication and I am not sure if you can ask questions and receive an answer.","2"
"R_1qmWoMHnhpce1bX","It's very complex, which would make it too expensive for schools. You don't need a physical robot for this, although it might be more effective. The technical quality is good. It has a very robotic voice, and loud movements. ","2"
"R_51Es4U6LJcbQWhM","It is extremely detailed and articulate for a robot.","2"
"R_1JQRZU3IUsIYnAP","The robot is obviously well able to move pieces on the chessboard. However, when it is talking about exerting influence on the the d5 square, it seemed to be trying to point, but it wasn't clear which square it was pointing to.","2"
"R_8TKWbdjs1BjkQPT","Good robot, nice movement. can explain moves","2"
"R_3zkznt2o2YAdllz","The robot is a good size.  Would be good in a school library.  To not bother others around it would be good to have headphones.","2"
"R_5Pmwq7vssQGs3pT","The quality of the robot is impeccable. Its simplicity is its most positive aspect. A chess robot needs only be able to move the pieces, nothing fancy is added.","2"
"R_1KJwoPhrvDV9I7h","The robot appears well-designed with precise movement and good integration with the chessboard, making it suitable for automated gameplay or teaching. However, it may lack human-like dexterity and could be slow in executing moves, which might affect real-time gameplay efficiency.","2"
"R_5pbSouhp2lQRoAz","The voice is very robotic but the operation is clear plus the guidance of the next steps","2"
"R_2n7zbZ0dxZe7WWJ","It explains which is a positive ","2"
"R_3WD9kgiVjiRbrBb","The movement was a little noisy.","2"
"R_5AYgz9TDrPz9qSx","I think young ones would tolerate it more than I do, it just seems unnecessarily robotic. Same thing could be done in a less robotic way.","2"
"R_1PGpJv96shLKo9Z","The robot seems to move smoothly and is able to grasp the chess pieces well and place them with precision. The voice is pleasant and sounds trustworthy.","2"
"R_7hV5bLoDxMywnT3","I like how descriptive it is and explains why every step is made ","2"
"R_7GExcqjqR9o8GEV","it is so understanding and intelligent to do what is required ","2"
"R_7ozEdxpdsEyvHe8","very clear, well spoken, highly intelligent, great for people with ADHD like me, I'm a visual learner. ","2"
"R_60SZapCmxWTOWUK","It looks very futuristic and clean, sounds very robotic but definitely advanced","2"
"R_295RNulztjFOsQF","The robot used very technical language which is good but also may be confusing to students ","2"
"R_6s0SofpwI1wbimM","it's going to fast and it's hard to follow and I don't think it can teach that well.","2"
"R_7C2cBvCyGVoD47k","It moves the pieces well and it's a smooth process but the robot is pretty big and bulky but it works so ok","2"
"R_77m3JC9Wm0RSkWi","I feel that the technical aspect of this is too much for what it is trying to achieve, which is to teach chess as the online tools are just as affective or even more affective as ChatGPT is prone to make mistakes and say nonsensical things from time to time ","2"
"R_1thXWKTbm2VM6Nz","I believe that it is technically correct. I do not know how to play chess so I could not be sure. The voice was very robotic.","2"
"R_5v8LOOyZFrPv63D","The robot moved fluidly but a bit slow. The overall dynamics of the robot are uninteresting as well.","2"
"R_256cMob4B7HLh73","The sound of it moving could be distracting from the lesson it is teaching ","2"
"R_2YzjrkxZ8C2T8ya","The robot explains clearly what it is doing and also does it accurately,","2"
"R_7fIXN2kpxFjVOmo","Negative aspects--it's using generative AI, a technology known for hallucinating results","2"
"R_8QAZzcL2kVJLXGl","Mostly positive it explained any move, and strategy very well","2"
"R_2KydrIlGL2aRxHE","Very slow, doesn't anticipate all moves","2"
"R_61dTfRWIMarMxO1","it has great quality and speaks very clearly","2"
"R_7pRJz136MNKmZ2h","It helps students to understand, but it does not teach according to varying student needs.","2"
"R_81jJUzSLXzKf4Ne","I’d it was used with children it would be better to look a bit cuter as that one is quite scary looking.  It needs a friendly face maybe some colour. ","2"
"R_7oGR3mS9kZLlwMc","I like the clear concise voice it uses to explain the moves it makes","2"
"R_1bUGS952920UxiA","It seems to be working as intended. ","2"
"R_7PdsR2d8EtLAd3u","its a bit choppy and not that helpful as no one knows what a sicilian defence is","2"
"R_8vm1qM6iVvMAaSl","The robot speaks clearly and explains things well, and looks be to manufactured very well, moving smoothly and quietly.","2"
"R_5a62Q9L08jC2EJr","I feel like the robot talks too much but has a lot of technical knowledge that would only be useful to someone who already knows how to play the game.","2"
"R_8BAJnL1Iv5aDgfD","It has a good understanding of the game and the movement of the robot is good.","2"
"R_8S4xJTnTdqgJNQt","It's a little slow and noisy and could get closer to the squares (such as D4 at the end) when indicating them. It looks good, though.","2"
"R_2vjiQ5DEgz9epqx","It moves smoothly and quickly. The noise could be a bit distracting. The voice was smooth and easy to listen to.","2"
"R_8NQaogNEgdWH9as","Stating what move the robot is playing is very good. Mentioning the power of moves is also very positive and opens up new ideas to be played. Also evaluates the position of each move and consequent moves.","2"
"R_87dSKxvjyqHDpU7","Some of the words used were confusing but the robot sounded quite human.","2"
"R_80jjHLSQ3Hq2Sn3","it looks pretty positive and works well","2"
"R_8kHectvnApXOlvM","I believe the robot is highly advanced and provides great reasoning as to why a specific move works well","2"
"R_5GQCFQLs2f8JSf1","I don't know much about chess but it seems capable of playing and explaining the reasoning behind the moves.","2"
"R_8Sl4DfNhlfWzeK4","Seems to love accurately and fluidly. It's smooth and rather quiet in terms of the mechanical or robotic noises.","2"
"R_20q0nn1sHJYamyw","The robot moves great, it has great arm control. I like the voice used. ","2"
"R_3xzXggFb8gnmA7f","The robot is starting its lesson assuming the student has prior knowledge of how pieces move, what the board squares are called, and strategy. It should start WAY more basic. It is noisy which was quite a distraction for me. I was impressed with how nimbly it grabbed and placed pieces. ","2"
"R_8RV73S0CyAHvWaf","The robot is very noisy and this makes it difficult to focus on what is being said. For a beginner it is far too complicated.","2"
"R_84l9p6dXPLiibyK","The robot's movements are smooth and the voice matches the speed of the movements","2"
"R_8cd9h43Fi1IRn0x","Very good quality. Friendly voice, smooth movements and nice neautral colour pallette.","2"
"R_5OH5BJT4hGUumjt","The voice quality was surprisingly good - easy to understand, not too fast and not too slow. The movements were fluid and again not too fast or too slow.","2"
"R_6trjDhfuuqQ6Dkt","Some difficulty understanding. ","2"
"R_5sdNem1ZBQi5Tgm","Speaks clear, clear movements","2"
"R_8G7PFWlYbalcCiJ","I thought it was very well explained an this would help visual learners. It was just as good as a human doing it.","2"
"R_8ivPgZUm8yYYiAw","Quality looks good - not flimsy, looks well made and suitable for the activity it's doing","2"
"R_7a8g7bmJvvNd3p1","It is capable of moving pieces where it wants to and teaching about chess strategy while doing so.","2"
"R_2kIaGdeMjy0XoxJ","The robot seemed very noisy, but very precise movements ","2"
"R_1kB3t6juYRaKDqD","it explaina why they are doing that move and facts about it. the negative aspect is: it's not a human, there's no space for conversation and questions.","2"
"R_2PALTK7BM4F5H6e","I think the robot is very deliberate in its moments, it's slow enough so that the person watching can comprehend what it's doing and the robot also explains how/why it's going through the process it is.","2"
"R_2eXz8jSqGsZnmdW","positive- clear explanation ","2"
"R_2wkwJs6k8DXKCiZ","Looks good, movements are smooth, if slow, design is sleak, and audio is clear.","2"
"R_88Ai1Ll9i77p3YR","It looks good and it also sounds great for learning.","2"
"R_5rjFMfjqBDDWk4J","Yes, it could help students learn interactively, making chess more engaging.","2"
"R_5zZnxLMm5gTmCha","thats pretty amazing","2"
"R_8mKkGlKda02v0Bu","The technical quality of the robot seems very good. It's able to explain why it's making certain moves and does them easily.","2"
"R_4mEq9Jfymd2aSu4","I like how it describes why it is making a certain move and the strategy behind the move.","2"
"R_20JJo0rEt4h96Qs","it was able to accurately pick up and move chess pieces.  it was easy to understand, but lacked emotion.  ","2"
"R_82wXXYU2vK4TqUh","I like that the explanation is clear and succinct, although I think that as someone who doesn't play chess (assuming this is for a beginner) that I wouldn't understand what id going on. I like how smooth the movement of the chess pieces is and it's clear where the robot is moving them to as it's saying where they will move to","2"
"R_3OIUMZPak1rWUaU","This is a very technologically  advanced robot.","2"
"R_6QMoGIDt4vMmuWi","It teaches technical points, but I need a human touch and feel","2"
"R_2eTLUYvDnefiNZD","It seems a bit industrial and a bit out of place as a teaching aid.","2"
"R_8bQbR6NMNCYlyA9","The robot looks so appealing and looks like it can do a lot of work ","2"
"R_2rcNW5hPeDlF1Cd","i really liked it. sounded good. nothing bad to say","2"
"R_6DZP0FllHylG3c6","I don’t care for the accent and it’s probably not for beginners.that don’t know what the moves are.","2"
"R_2HkRWxYtXZbQQw4","moves very smoothly and voice is human sounding. is a bit intimidating though. highlights relevant positions well","2"
"R_3E0JA91AB8cQB4e","IT's very fluid and clear in the way it is talking. it could use more pauses in how it talks","2"
"R_279XLEE08mj4Fgt","It really moves quickly and smoothly and seems very in control of the pieces. It looks so much better than I expected it to. No negatives","2"
"R_2IQTCJABeGsZk69","explained the scillian opening well , only spoke about one line","2"
"R_2BzJvpBVVEtsFuU","The robot was smooth in its movements. There were a couple of unnecessary movements made when it was giving further explanation of the chess moves made and why.","2"
"R_6oCq0z119Rlj4so","negative: no communication with the robot positive: sound too loud","2"
"R_2Mslwr0yHE2jb0t","I think the robot is great at teaching chess","2"
"R_65KfUmUiarHq2RZ","Fairly quiet, efficient, not overly intrusive","2"
"R_5veHTaLqtxoTzBD","I like how he mentioned the Sicilian defense and specific moves. Reminds me of watching that chess show ","2"
"R_3r00YMfvKorcXC5","Nice looking robot it talks to you while it moves.","2"
"R_8duB66xog5TTzTJ","The information was interesting but very boring. The voice was uninteresting and i could concentrate on it.","2"
"R_4NaWwBnSYHEO44n","The robot looks nice and clean but it's too noisy when it moves.","2"
"R_2rN4MQPM6lEFNXK","I think it’s really impressive how precise the movements of this robot is. ","2"
"R_2jDMsLTPUoBKefP","The robot looks very technically competent. Its fluidity is a positive for me","2"
"R_7Bvn53DRUL8jCH7","Technically it's impressive and precise.","2"
"R_4rIlAi58LTU86Vl","It took a little bit to realise that the robot was indicating to the D4 square, this was potentially confusing. It could have mentioned that it was indicating to the square.","2"
"R_19OGNf2KjdlZ345","I like that the robot named the moves. ","2"
"R_6sYyVlLhG4zivNk","It seems to be accurate and precise.","2"
"R_82z7P5pdPBdQNfm","Not personable but quite effective at teaching this type of game","2"
"R_62Xj6NVSYKBrPpt","Robot movies fluidly and the voice instructions are easy to follow.","2"
"R_2zLJRDxrZJ2vGIw","It has good dexterity and knowledge ","2"
"R_2zIlo1WqrRdEgRH","The robot is very precise and makes the correct moves as its speaking which is certainly a positive. Can't think of a negative at this moment.","2"
"R_80jUEeJBKIUuejM","It's a little slow,   ","2"
"R_67vxHBwE3noRL3L","The build quality seems quite high, the robot is capable of pretty accurate movements without disrupting the other pieces on the chess board. It does however appear to be quite loud.","2"
"R_2flGXlDTqiBltND","Explains clearly what shot to play where to place it and even names the move.","2"
"R_5HT75J4iPtDbVTV","Makes too many background sounds when in motion which would distract many people attempting to learn. A little slow and not enough explanation. ","2"
"R_5e2F8T8LtRR6044","Seems very technically competent, but not human","2"
"R_2DXR9Cfab2S5Wwu","The robot is very clear in his actions and what he is doing.","2"
"R_6EBaNsH85uiWNKx","It seemed good, however, describing the boxes as D5 etc means one would have to know which box is what number. Besides that, seems like it is teaching someone how to play, although I would need to watch an entire game to really understand the rules.","2"
"R_1CKF57SkvbWhFPg","i think it is just like a computer software but 3d","2"
"R_2sYbdmGorjXQQ4J","From the clip, it appears in working order and has a simple yet efficient design. ","2"
"R_6i2pn4IWXr9qqDo","good amount of spacing between talking points to allow the listener to understand clearly","2"
"R_22hvEi0o9sNQjPI","The robot itself must be very technical, and therefore a costly piece of machinery. This wouldnt be appropriate for every state school but a fun way to learn chess.","2"
"R_80nMekUcyui4TZL","It's very delicate and precise. Explaining the reasons for the moves whilst doing them could be really useful to someone learning.","2"
"R_13kDkWm77hDXRdT","Positive quality would be accurately placement. Negative quality is slower than a human being","2"
"R_4q7LdYmlooFmcvh","Personally, I don't play chess so it's hard for me to comment about the technical quality of the robot. However, it does describe the name of the moves it makes and it mentions some of the characteristics of those moves.","2"
"R_7fQ38iuwAa0QHPu","Seems quite capable and smooth, although a little louder than I would want for a learning environment. The voice also seemed natural and elegant, matching the atmosphere of a chess game,","2"
"R_74dDo4vhxK8dhfJ","Great, impressive. it is engaging and captures your attention like  some kind of uncanny feeling, an alien perhaps, taking to you, but it is human made.","2"
"R_28MbrvitCuDqsRK","it appears well functioning but moves slowly","2"
"R_8JIXPiwrTAf4ava","It depends on the robot’s capabilities. If the robot can play chess at different skill levels, explain moves, and engage with students interactively, it could be a great tool for teaching chess in schools.","2"
"R_23ZVxWqUKSrfDOo","positive being it sounds like it gives good descriptions of instructions and difference tactics.","2"
"R_7ef8mgsmZgDMXSR","I like that the robot can pick up chess pieces and move them around while explaining the reasons or the consequences of moving. I actually do not like the robot talking because it seems very fake to me as if it is directly using someone's voice or imitating someone's voice.","2"
"R_544kr69KL5XmMnv","It looks friendly and not complicated at all, so everyone would get along pretty well with it.","2"
"R_8hc1QSdrr7qNB2M","The robot technically built in human standard and aggregation which give better knowledge  ","2"
"R_43xnPUDIzs5UFtk","Explaining the moves is incredibly informative. It's clear and decisive.","2"
"R_2TYwgLdFvo17Cr2","it gives a more simple undrestanding about how chess moves can be made","2"
"R_84O6XFfrNVijZ7z","It seems very precise. It’s clear to see what it’s doing and providing easily understandable commentary on why it’s doing it.","2"
"R_7tGrP60fLLUdve5","The technical quality seems to be good, the robot clearly states what its doing and why its making the moves it is. ","2"
"R_1OuD9B2aVMvzl6y","Its ability to move pieces is good. I think the machine's moving parts are a little loud. The accent is done well but the voice itself needs improvement.","2"
"R_2UBGZx6nCK3Mda1","not really technical.","2"
"R_8ARwzzqhePmpiU2","placement is precise and smooth, as is the speech.","2"
"R_7Ca4kXhHNpWaLI0","I liked the clear voice that was used by the robot and it would be easy to hear","2"
"R_4FJozkt6yM1dy6E","It's interesting how it runs commentary while playing. I think it's positive as this shows off everything it can do and I wonder how it works with a human opponent.","2"
"R_30enTHfRetujlby","The robot seems very precise, which is a positive.","2"
"R_21jipFCVUzlyBk4","it is clear with its movements and explanation","2"
"R_23fqE7p9Pqwcmht","its very good because its improve  everything","2"
"R_18CYBF0mJ6G0eKz","The robot has the ability to move pieces well. I think this is helpful because many people are visual and tactile learners, so it's better than learning on a computer screen. It also seemed to have a good level of knowledge about different tactics and techniques.","2"
"R_7DJChpilD4WBrJ7","It appears the technical quality is good.  Easily understood, and capable movements","2"
"R_9OlbKkfyA3JYW9P","Its very robotic and i don’t that the best way to teach kids anything let alone chess","2"
"R_2K3fZZX056phOhz","Positive - The robot's voice is clear, and easy to understand. The instructions were also concise with additional context shared on the benefits of the moves selected.  Negative - the sound that is made each time the robot hand moves up and down was perhaps somewhat distracting","2"
"R_1sbVAEKsoeaucsP","It was very clear what the robot was saying. From my angle it was hard to see the squares exactly but if I was in front of that robot it would of been very helpful. ","2"
"R_4DZ0SwgcPoLSPob","The robot is very good at explaining what moves it is doing and why, it is also quite good at communicating/interacting with the chess game being played. From what I can see it can strategize its plays based on what the opponent did or does which is quite unique for a robot.","2"
"R_8HSJGxWGMdqPBYd","It seems to know exactly what it’s doing and is even forward thing","2"
"R_5gGRaALZjWAc6rf","The robot was able to explain the moves, the piece used, and was able to grab specific pieces showing good technical quality. ","2"
"R_2M0dicBc3VqO8uf","It looks very simple and easy on the eyes. Maybe less visible cables will make it a bit more neat and tidy. ","2"
"R_3xRZ4NtFqII38bg","The robot looks well built with high quality materials. It operates somewhat loudly.","2"
"R_8qkgMxtw3k4rIpH","The robot is very clear on the positions and instructions it is giving. It also has good timing to not make the move until it has explained what is going on.","2"
"R_31TvfwohANbhw8q","Well I believe that the quality of this robot is great and also might be useful in teaching students.","2"
"R_6YXPkMzQ1eSkWuB","I found the technical quality to be good as it explains in a clear language what it is engaging in and I believe this would be a positive for learning the game of chess.","2"
"R_6dG1K2jzV9se34u","I think it is understandable and could be a good aid.","2"
"R_6dj3cOfND0W33eB","Well, it's definitely highly robotic and it's movements are a bit jarring.  The voice is actually nice and easy to follow, and not monotone, which makes it more engaging.  The whirring of the robot is a bit distracting however in the context of a lesson like this. ","2"
"R_8Cki7GpXEIci8NT","The robot does a great job at picking up and moving the chess pieces as well as explaining what it's doing. I just find the voice used a bit unsettling and it feels like it doesn't fit the robot. I'm not sure if it's just the camera angle but it seems like the robot doesn't accurately point at D4 square.","2"
"R_7ozdVWPJhM5LvPz","It is a very futuristic feeling concept. A mechanical arm controlled expertly to control chess pieces requires immense precision. This is very fascinating. One issue would be the delicate nature of the machine. Depending on the schooling, this arm is likely to be damaged due to the chaotic nature of children. The ability for this machine to withstand wear and tear of schooling is something to be considered.","2"
"R_6LSeev8X0ykhxS6","looks good but what if someone has a question","2"
"R_4nfnwzkVMZpIumC","The voice over explains things really well but the physical arm that moves the pieces doesn't point very well at the relevant squares.","2"
"R_7incRtwkTMI5DeK","The robot seems to move with ease and able to pick up and place the chess pieces where it wants. ","2"
"R_1ifEIt6S98Rj7sC","It's a very nice and clean looking robot. It moves precisely but gently. ","2"
"R_5v0JfEUOuMud7ph","The robot moves very precisely and is able to gently work with the chess pieces.","2"
"R_2gBgh1zh135ctbV","It moved quickly and accurately if a little noisily","2"
"R_8OTLMh8JaB0XjD6","The robot seems technically competent in the clip. The description of the moves seem accurate and it moves the pieces with precision ","2"
"R_2lbJ7Wy3nGLbmMn","very informative, knows about the subject and explains it in an easy to understand manner","2"
"R_2ONlD0oX7HFe8qP","Takes time to explain what it's doing, and the combination of seeing it in real time and the explanation seems very compelling.","2"
"R_1JbaXDoxh6AKNVZ","Very positive. It's good quality and pretty easy to fellow.","2"
"R_6AGwkQ7YF8QddUu","The technical quality of the robot was great. It begins to take action, syncing the movement of the chess pieces along with the AI response. Some parts of the AI response are used to explain the reasoning behind the moves without actually moving a piece. The robot acts on these, if it happens often, this could be distracting. ","2"
"R_2CDu3O8TwNgAheP","The voice has some expression but mostly it sounds very robotic and not very enthusiastic. ","2"
"R_3irIMsWwCExz0W2","The robot is very precise and fairly quick.","2"
"R_1disSmMcyIcETHQ","I like how the robot points to the squares when describing the chess strategy. For example, instead of simply mentioning the D5 square with the audio, the robot moves over the square itself to indicate the position in question. This can be beneficial to students who are also visual learners. The audio quality of the robot is clear and informative, even though the audio is computer generated. The one thing I am concerned about is how to setup the chess board appropriately so that the robot knows the correct positions on the chessboard. In other words, if the chess board is not setup with exact measurements, the squares indicated by the robot, may not line up with the actual square being described by the robot. Lastly, I thought it was a big positive aspect that the robot could control both the white and the black teams without having to have human input (like a human player controlling the opposite team). I think this will be very helpful in teaching students when both sides can be controlled by the robot. ","2"
"R_8SqOEs0sfvBDoQH","I believe the robot was wrong about the move 'e4', they said it's an aggressive opening but I believe it to be very positional and 'd4' being the more aggressive option. It was correct about 'c5' being the Sicilian defence. They completely missed the move 'c3' and the pawn never moved. ","2"
"R_8NrAAq2xt9ZyWeZ","The technical quality is quite good because the robot explains the reasons behind each move and why the opponent would also be making certain moves.","2"
"R_2CQaCP9aQjaKAaK","It moves well and explains the purpose of the moves its conducting which could be helpful to a student who is learning to play chess. Its also helpful that it points to the squares it is talking about or moves a piece to the aforementioned squares. I think the gap between some of its dialogue is a negative that could be improved. ","2"
"R_8gBJsRLGo7bkr85","It's very technical, so it might be better to dum down the explanations for beginners until they have basic knowledge of the game ","2"
"R_54fayvdTk11jPoy","The voice is a bit strange but the overall design is cool and would appeal to students ","2"
"R_2q8KRW6z4U8rM1K","It seems to be of high quality; it's impressive that a robot can not only understand [or at least appear to understand] chess and move pieces on a physical board but also explain what it's doing and why.","2"
"R_6VrDez8DDOBSmn7","The robot seems patient and thoughtful, I really like how it explains how to play the game while also showing how to do it as well. Im honestly not sure if I think there are any negatives to this. I would quite enjoy learning how to play chess like this. ","2"
"R_80o8rchxJlxKx5n","The robot seems knowledgeable on chess and is able to explain common strategies very well. In addition to this, it also explains what each move does, not that its just popular.","2"
"R_8CeSUPSYbb9U5QC","it seems ok and does the job, but if going to use in schools it may be needs to look less clinical. It reminds me of equipment used at the opticians used to photograph the back of the eyes.","2"
"R_1FkyHNKN4Hjm8SS","The sound is very clear and easy to understand","2"
"R_3fxUWqRawVA6DVT","It shows clarity in explaining the actions of the moves.","2"
"R_1owmEbks7QItSX2","The dialogue is good, it gives some personality.","2"
"R_8lMc7B8tRApNRD3","I thought the movement, back and forth as though considering the board, looked natural.","2"
"R_2dHaUnJWcXC3105","The robot seems simple in design but very suitable for its purpose","2"
"R_2k1FWeKstaYwmwO","It moves the pieces well and explains what it is doing well. It could perhaps give more detail on why it is making the moves it is.","2"
"R_8KSByQ7nj4nX4UH","The information given seemed to be truthful. The voice used is in clear English and has a good tone. The movement of pieces was steady and deliberate. It seemed to point towards the opposing side of the board to make a point more clear.","2"
"R_8PfmdhsLNU2Waqd","The robot clearly understands the nature of the game, and advices as such.","2"
"R_5170IxzMVySbbfY","On the positive side, it effectively recognizes and states chess moves, which suggests accurate moves and a solid understanding of chess notation. Its ability to consistently relay moves without errors is a strength. However, its lack of explanatory depth makes it feel unidimensional. A well-rounded chess assistant should ideally provide insights, such as explaining the reasoning behind moves, evaluating positions, or suggesting alternatives. If it struggles with these aspects, it may lack strong AI-driven evaluation or natural language processing capabilities.","2"
"R_1mygiVnsvnfzYBG","The robot was moving well but the whirring noise every time it moved was distracting.","2"
"R_2dF4Sd87lNBrRuZ","The technical ability of the robot moves smoothly and knows what it is doing","2"
"R_5m2MSvphjNA0vfj","High quality robot! I liked the English accent, he sounds smart","2"
"R_2PU0e4rqsrlKK9H","I think it’s very positive, as someone learning to play chess I think it explains why the move is a good move and the robot moves side to side allowing you to move any object ","2"
"R_2arj0nNO9q5nguw","The robot moves with accuracy and timings match the audio","2"
"R_8bV30ixbJwGcVPv","It makes quite a lot of mechanical noise as it moves, this could potentially distract the user. It looks as if it would likely be of a high technical standard, however, and I imagine rather expensive for that reason! The level of technical knowledge sounded convincing to me...as a non-chess player! Plus it looked as if it managed to move to the various locations on the board as one would expect for a chess playing robot. ","2"
"R_3YKYRTAAudWRaH3","Nothing at all...............","2"
"R_3neKTqklEw8077r","I thought the robot functioned properly and without issue. Seemed very humanlike.","2"
"R_2CAXvOZclUnhkg5","Robot's movements were clean and precise. Audio matched well to the movements.","2"
"R_8Lil2JAe65ofPka","It explains it’s moved very well and is accurate ","2"
"R_2FkMa3exvAElUQb","It looks very capable but seems a little overkill as there are much simpler systems that move pieces using mechanics inder the board.","2"
"R_8THGToN58NR6pBU","The robot is too fast for a learner. Though it depends on the students' age bracket. ","2"
"R_4NvNuKocRkisW9K","The size is a bit jarring but the movements seem precise. The sound could also be annoying after a while especially in a quiet environment. ","2"
"R_1efVMveFQleVFiq","I'm amazed at how precise the movements are! ","2"
"R_3effLHLpIa8DsS6","The robot's precision is impressive and it explains things very well. I think that everything can now be replaced with artificial intelligence. I don't see anything negative in the robot","2"
"R_6iKeCT50peQs9Lf","While this robot does not appear to have full mobility capabilities if there were a miniature version assigned to each child's desk it would perhaps give students more individualized attention. There is no need to have the robot appear more human-like while doing the chess demonstration it displayed a depth of knowledge and skillset making mobility not an issue. ","2"
"R_7n0YAlUNpn9XSsc","Playing chess is not slow","2"
"R_6zhJujjkQdtrhpT","Its very precise with reasoning and provides details for each move which is nice to have when learning. It seems to get a bit confused near the end with unnecessary movement.","2"
"R_6nxgtsv4zEeZ3EH","the quality of the robot is high when it is taken to school to teach students.can better understand and keep the concentration on it rather than a teacher","2"
"R_1V7NdmfTI9tmtBN","The robot is obviously very well built and programmed. It explains the reason for the movements with chess terminology. However, if people don't know chess terminology, it would still be easy to get lost.","2"
"R_7gNSth5y2PrzjHg","It sounds like a robot definitely, if I was a student I would not understand it’s teaching ","2"
"R_2BtUkqKxKLbdAaX","the technical quality is perfectly fine","2"
"R_7HzPI87ILy3LO0H","Very efficient movements and nice explanation of chess concepts. ","2"
"R_2kumFR7bXoo5k2J","Too technical. One has to know the actual positions and be able to take in his comments as he speaks to quickly","2"
"R_3GK9MAuCRSp8GkS","I think it would be a very positive addition to put in schools to teach everyone how to play chess","2"
"R_8cUBTXrjeEqbwfD","The robot seems completely functional and moves smoothly and with precision. Its voice is also clear and easy to understand.","2"
"R_8Hk1ZYuWBC6z3dF","Very technically apt in chess, it explains why some moves are made and the possible response for them. ","2"
"R_2ozlRcIZoDwzO38","The robot is quite good as it is able to make some very good moves. The robot can predict a very matching combination ","2"
"R_41lLSiE3YjXdIad","i think it is positive as it explains why it doing that move and what the options are.","2"
