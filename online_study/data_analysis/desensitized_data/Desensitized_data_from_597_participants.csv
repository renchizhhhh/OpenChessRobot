Tactile and Physical Engagement – Many players prefer physical chessboards over digital screens. A robot that moves pieces and provides real-time coaching could offer a more immersive experience. 	2.	Better for Young Learners – Interactive robots could help children stay engaged and reduce screen time while learning chess. 	3.	AI and Adaptive Learning – Future robots will likely have stronger AI with personalized coaching, similar to Chess.com or Lichess, but in a real-world setting. 	4.	Classroom and Group Use – Robots could be useful for schools and chess clubs where multiple students can observe and interact without needing individual devices.  Why Screens Won’t Be Fully Replaced 	1.	Versatility of Screens – Chess apps allow for online play, advanced analysis, and access to massive databases of games, which a robot may struggle to replicate. 	2.	Cost and Accessibility – High-quality chess robots with AI coaching would be expensive, whereas chess software on a tablet or PC is widely accessible. 	3.

For example, instead of simply mentioning the D5 square with the audio, the robot moves over the square itself to indicate the position in question. This can be beneficial to students who are also visual learners. The audio quality of the robot is clear and informative, even though the audio is computer generated. The one thing I am concerned about is how to setup the chess board appropriately so that the robot knows the correct positions on the chessboard. In other words, if the chess board is not setup with exact measurements, the squares indicated by the robot, may not line up with the actual square being described by the robot. Lastly, I thought it was a big positive aspect that the robot could control both the white and the black teams without having to have human input (like a human player controlling the opposite team). I think this will be very helpful in teaching students when both sides can be controlled by the robot. ","Firstly, to aid in showing what square is being described the robot, I believe it would be helpful for the robot to have an attached light source that would highlight the square in question once the robot's arm moves over that square. Secondly, I heard recently about ChatGPT may be able to have more human sounding voices based on user input. Maybe, the robot could be taught to use a voice that is familiar to the students, such as of a popular celebrity, or their teacher. I think this would help the robot to be more familiar and engaging, as the robotic voice may sound a bit dull. To build on this, giving the robot a human name may help keep children engaged with the learning. ","Yes. I believe this robot does a much better job of showing the chess strategies in a 3D space, rather than in a 2D board on a computer screen. Seeing the chess strategies in a real environment in my opinion is more effective on teaching children how to recognize chess strategies while also learning new ones. Lastly, the robot is almost like having a real teacher in the room, which I believe is vastly superior for a learning experience instead of having the children listen to computer audio while staring at a computer screen.
