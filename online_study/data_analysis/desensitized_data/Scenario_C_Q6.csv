"R_3EzcI77fiFaKakb","It kind of talks a lot.","3"
"R_5gMeUa9rNE0pVy3","I think that it could move a bit faster or have a HAL 9000 red dot to make it more immersive  ","3"

"R_8L2do58ywi65zzk","It is quite large, so a smaller version could improve it.","3"
"R_8fFEJdxcJsOf0xH","Seems like it is quite big and would take up a lot of space at home. It could provide the rationale for the alternatives proposed.","3"

"R_8iIRQ6j6XJxJyos","The voice, whilst clear, is very monotonous and quite boring. A little more variation in vocal tone would help keep me interested more.","3"
"R_2mq7e5z0vVKUjMA","Possibly moving away from the clinical white and black all tech companies use. maybe going for cleaner or more fun colour schemes to make it more personal or to fit in other styles","3"
"R_22M2AjmbyMpL1mm","Make the movements quieter.","3"
"R_2TIlAWtWDeaYUkp","The movement noise I would find slightly annoying so I think if it was smoother without the start stop sort of motion ","3"
"R_7lGiSAvlNsTvDiV","In the video it gave options to make several different moves. It may already be able to do this, but I think an option for randomizing the next move would be appealing to chess players. ","3"
"R_8lzxGU2jOe37rq1","Make it sleeker. Ensure that the audio is more sophisticated and natural.","3"
"R_5rOFdn51mfIU2L7","I couldn't understand why it was just talking about potential moves to make and then asking the user what it wants it to do - wouldn't the point of the robot be to replicate being an opponent? So telling it what moves to make would be no different than playing alone?","3"

"R_7W6WESfeUZdm2oV","it’s loud and large and probably wouldn’t fit into people’s lifestyles ","3"
"R_8OCXI98XluohHDC","I don't like the noise it makes when moving/rotating","3"
"R_6fqftFb1dzyOaH4","I think if the robot were to show more emotion it would seem as if your talking to an actual human otherwise it shows that it is AI operated.","3"
"R_8B3P7hBf6gBtXRX","Maybe give it a more personal or softer design.","3"
"R_71DoJ12LUehrWff","While very interesting, it could use more human features, maybe incorporate a face of some sort with expression","3"
"R_87qgVKTXoJWNY3T","No, I do not know anything about robots unfortunately","3"
"R_8qaMj9uvzxKKCer","i think it looks too much like a ""robot"". it would be better if it looked like something else. ","3"
"R_2feDdmGE5um9eDH","Make it move faster. Can it do similes of human expression (thinking, pausing etc)?","3"
"R_8OG20dF268viX3b","It could be more fluid in its movements, if appears to be responding to programming, of course. But it would be more natural from a human perspective if this were less obvious. ","3"
"R_5nlnhT3lVhVBxUw","I would make an improvement on the look of the robot, it seems very basic and boring.","3"
"R_639lQXCaPrD2wG1","Not really. It would be cool if it had a screen on it so that it could put images up while it talked","3"
"R_8YbL1EGMItqUgBN","The whirring sound as it moves is quite distracting","3"
"R_36fNTn997q9xztW","Perhaps you could offer some sort of custom colour according to  the owner's preference.","3"
"R_511bADMoDcYjEAN","not at this time. I really don't know what would improve it","3"
"R_5c2jwMgveysPvG1","Give it a face, to make it seem like we are interacting.","3"

"R_2faYvLYX3Pqi8al","Make it look less like a robot. Make it quiter.","3"
"R_84nEA68TKOUfoMp","Having the option to have a male or female voice. The ability to customise. Perhaps making it a little smaller so it is could potentially be portable. ","3"
"R_4P5gzq8kB9mGL45","I do not have any recommendations","3"
"R_84Hrbp3wlncoFae","You could give it a more friendly and human look with a head, perhaps. This would make it easier to play a game with the robot if it was more of an equal.","3"
"R_8COxlEPvu5PCZgg","It's appearance looks quite clinical","3"
"R_8rZQjmc2Sy8uAjg","no I think it is great as is","3"
"R_8eqcjeFwVv6NoPg","The voice of the ""AI"" is not wholly convincing. It comes across as too artificial for my taste. Improving the realism of the voice would help.","3"
"R_9Ck3wzwhFtihMPE","More slim line. Even if the robot wasn’t a hand but was even in the board and could move the pieces from underneath ","3"

"R_8qXhQlvnw6RJhf3","make it smaller and a neater robot,","3"

"R_52gy5wQBh5OvwGm","Motion & Control Enhancements:  If movements are jerky, refine motor control algorithms (e.g., PID tuning). If speed is inconsistent, optimize motion planning and actuator response. Stability & Balance Improvements:  For walking robots, improve weight distribution and use better gyroscopes/IMUs for balance. For wheeled robots, adjust wheel traction and suspension. Sensor & Perception Upgrades:  If the robot struggles to detect objects, enhance its cameras, LiDAR, or ultrasonic sensors. Improve sensor fusion to combine multiple data sources for better decision-making. ","3"
"R_4phBIyXpUEA2Lwg","Lessen the noise when it moves if possible and maybe wrap it in something to imitate the appearance of a human arm and hand ","3"
"R_21NBDzSUkXsPuud","No immediate recommendations, as do not know enough about the technology and it is not fair to judge by a short video. ","3"
"R_3dX9RQg9gxEF2yC","I think it would be cool if you could change its voice to a female or different type of accent. Also at times I found its movements loud and speech hindered a bit","3"
"R_8P6flJKcdFm1DHj","Maybe a screen showing a face,","3"
"R_3OOijoZgBxluhOO","I think if it didnt have any wires it would be cooler maybe a cooler design too","3"
"R_3xADPAg6GKe3RC1","I thought it was decent but it seemed limited in range; I would have like to see more flexibility in motion. ","3"

"R_6bzwaHhdSn04r0B","Make it cheaper or else you will get a very small amount of rich chess lovers wanting this for home entertainment or a bar or restaurant using it for fun.","3"
"R_8AYjves5E09DdDj","I think a quieter motor to reduce the hum and buzz during movements, maybe a less clinical colour, something more neutral rather than a stark white.","3"
"R_8CfdmC9uIOQiCqZ","Reduce the size of the robot it looks intimidating.","3"
"R_9Vg5C5OOoahk7oM","Don't believe so. It could be a little less tall, have a better movement capability.","3"

"R_5oXVqrBiTdmrRxR","Not at all, i do not have any recommendations.","3"
"R_2GxMjZxDgqDNcuQ","The tone is very flat and the explanation itself feels a bit soulless, which I guess is just a result of it being trained through a chatGPT input. I feel for it to have a wider appeal, others may expect it to be more expressive.","3"
"R_3qCZAwMPdSzFdw5","Perhaps give it various options for voices, such as female.","3"
"R_3JpBR0V1nLk4jEl","Maybe make it more visually appealing or customizable. Let people choose the color. Also for those who can't hear, add captions somewhere on the robot that work like a teleprompter would. ","3"

"R_2oSfCQF25sK9PXw","make it more human looking , and less sounds of movement when it is in motion","3"
"R_8s0RpYlhgPx0yS4","Just the appearance would need to be improved. Feel like there’s a lot of wires everywhere and exposed. ","3"
"R_2FRHptRTFnrbXmp","It could be made smaller and with quicker movement.","3"
"R_7qInihKkpRceS3J","The looks of the robot are strange. If it were a realistic hand maybe that would be more entertaining. ","3"
"R_2F2mhvQbarhNpxl","It could be more visually interesting ","3"
"R_5KqCrMFGHUyVqZL","Less wires so better visually ","3"
"R_6c6DPe0IFlAkzik","Maybe try to make it more silent because it's pretty loud when it moves.","3"
"R_65apGsEDsPlMpOx","The robot's voice could use a little work, it is not very pleasing to listen to. I think the arm could be much more smoother and less squeeling sounds.","3"
"R_7cjLueNOoH5zJx7","Seems fine to me! Maybe make it a bit more human with some humor?","3"
"R_1ffJP1gYJXCwvFL","If possible, limit the movement sounds as much as possible. Perhaps have a way to speed up the voice for those who are impatient, if that is also possible. ","3"

"R_2Cl5QMdC9ayXoSB","You can dress it up however you want, it'll still just be a creepy robot.","3"
"R_8nGRvrmPSvGZWo1","It shouldn't touch a piece unless it is going to move it.  Basic rule.","3"
"R_8CfI8LCc5TqF1qj","I guess it sounded a little noisy as it made the moves but that is probably expected. Perhaps a little less noisy moves might be a better experience. Excellent and clear communication from the robot. ","3"
"R_9DpCPIBN5QHSU77","I think the audio/speaking could be improved to sound less like a prerecorded message and more conversational to feel more ‘real’","3"
"R_1DnAQE48HAEKCFI","I'm not sure but it seems like something with a smaller form factor and more flexible and less noisy movement would be good.","3"
"R_4gjUBYa4qHu4jXN","Maybe less movement would be helpful. Heading all the way back to neutral before moving to the next piece makes it seem very unnatural and slow.","3"
"R_81GdDzSxaJiGYMF","Improve the design. It looks like a flailing robot arm. I'm sure there's a way to make it look more appealing.","3"
"R_8aHhb65oG82KJUt","perhaps not so bulky","3"
"R_2Pq8r7O233Ef271","I feel changing the voice is a must. The more adventurous approach would to select a voice or an accent for the robot with a lot more character. ","3"

"R_8hzrvxgtigSnbpV","A smaller version closer to the board and if there was some noise reduction in the movements it would be better for playing chess.","3"
"R_7yIT4EXpIbXIKuB","The robot could also mention what would happen if the chess pieces moved to a certain spot. For example, if the Queen was place at b7, what could the opponent do?","3"
