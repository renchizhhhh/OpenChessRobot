"Q7_Response"
"Yes, I think robots could be helpful and serve as a replacement because seeing the action in 3D is easier to understand than seeing the same thing on a screen. "
"It's possible, but I would need to see code along with the explanation."
"Maybe in some scenarios but not all. I think it would be good to teach certain visual to people in a classroom as addition to screens."
"Possibly, but I think people could benefit from learning from both."
"I do. I feel that their are various situations were have to read something on a screen does not explain as well as a person point things out. A robot like this could replicate that experience."
"Maybe. I don't really know what your asking. I think computers will still have a place in educating people in 10 years. I'm sure robots will also have a role, but not sure they'll be a replacement for computers altogether."
"This robot cannot replace because people have questions and may need something explained again unless they can make it respond to human responses "
"Yes I agree, if society can develop an open-minded standpoint on the use of technology."
"It is possible that robots like this could replace screen-based computers to understand technical topics. It would depend on the specific technology and how it performs. I think there will always be a use for screen-based computers, however."
"I really don't know much about computer vision. Probably? It has sensors and can grab..."
"Absolutely, I believe with AI intelligent and how quickly they have already picked up on a lot of stuff, it wont be long until they have perfected everything and manage to find the fastest and most efficient ways to do them."
"Technologically yes, but schools likely won’t have enough funding to implement these as intended "
"Yes, they are easier to visualize than classic comouters."
"Yup, technology advances so fast"
"Yes, robots are more precise and accurate than a human. They would make less mistakes."
"no; i think that AI isn't going to advance enough to be useful and that it will go on a similar trajectory to blockchain eventually, at least the LLM version that is being pushed right now."
"yes, could point to things to assist"
"Yes because it ensures physocslly engaging. It is very important especially for beginners. Because it includes different sense at the same time"
"no, i dont think a arm robot can explain everything"
"I dont think so it would be too expensive"
"I feel that this kind of robot won't as it won't be one that humans can relate to easily. Such information is also easier to take in on a screen as well."
"yes, it seems as they are being developed more and more every year and becoming smarter"
"Yes, AI is evolving so quickly I see no reason why robots cannot replace many computer functions."
"I don't think so, I think people will still be using screens on phones and TV's and tablet, so I can't see that disappearing within a decade."
"Mayne but I'm really not sure because I know that maybe there could be some tech errors"
"In some aspects yes for physical demonstration however the overall cost and benefits to do so are not strong enough as other existing and implemented technologies are already doing a decent job "
"I hope not, well not altogether atleast. It's very odd and impersonal. It's a clever idea but the one tone robot voice just makes me uninterested from the start. "
"definetley if it gets more advanced and developed "
"Absolutely, this provides a clear, real-life situation and how the robot behaves/interprets data. Some students may have difficulties visualizing such concepts without a live model before them. "
"Yes. I think the rate at which technology, particularly AI is developing, this is a strong possibility. "
"Yes as they are more interactive "
"I don't think so because I don't think within ten year people will accept it. It will take longer than that to condition people to accept these robots."
"maybe so, they are still a bit clunky looking, so i think they would have to work smoother"
"Maybe, maybe not. I think screen-based computers with videos have the capacity to show show more content and nuanced details."
"no, , it would always be useful for people to see a map of what a computer is doing to understand the thought process."
"This robots could definitely serve as a replacement because of how it will be able to easily explain orally and also show how the concept works"
"I absolutely think they can replace convention screen base computers in a few years because people do not want to work anymore"
"I think it could be a possibility but it seems very costly and I'm not sure what new or enhanced features would be added that it would be necessary to invest in these robots to replace existing computers that work fine."
"Its possible yes, the prototype already displays a vision where one could conceive that this would be possible within the next 10 years. But it would likely take AI progressing as fast as it is now to achieve this."
"Technically yes. But with the drive for ever more compact devices it would seem counter productive"
"No - I still think it is important for humans to have high rates of involvement in these scenarios."
"I believe they could help along side a screen based computer to help establish both a visual and kinetic means of learning for those that benefit over one or the other, however I don’t think a complete replacement would help in the teaching process. "
"I don't think so because we can just use an ai system that doesn't take up too much space."
"highly unlikely there is still a long way to go including affordability compared to computers "
"Maybe, it is quite possible."
"I hope not. AI in and of itself is a great tool, but the fact nobody Really knows how it works and that it IS making up it's own language..scary stuff. The termiinator coming to life for real"
"In some way, the robot will probably still need more input to understand what is required in order to explain well to other people "
"Unlikely to replace screen-based computers given the current need for those computers which is unlikely to go away. The robots don't have the same reason to be scaled. "
"It would be nice, but probbaly not cost-effective to do, compared to screen-based learning. Screen are already widely available, and can deliver a wide range of content or services. "
"Probably, but seems excessive"
"Possibly. Very practical. But expensive."
"yes most definitely, i believe AI and robotics are the future"
"Yes, I think to have a moving object in the room would be very engaging "
"Yes, technology is moving so fast each yeah I can see them helping us learn so many different things "
"Yes because seeing a real world example in real life can give students a better and deeper understanding on certain more nuanced and complicated topics"
"Possibly, but screens are accessible at all times while robots may not be."
"Probably will yes, but they will get more interesting"
"Maybe, I think in that case they should be interacting with the viewers."
"No, I believe a human will always be better at explaining misconceptions that a robot may not pick up on"
"I think so. But at the result of negative impact on humanity.  "
"Yes as there is a decline in teaching jobs and also students are not learning with some teachers"
"No, some students may not engage with a talking voice and instead learn by doing"
"Yes because it is much easier to understand with a real-life scenario as an example."
"Possible yes with how technology is evolving and progressing "
"I think for certain things it can, however for some people working with a robot could be quite intimidating but over the next ten years we will likely get used to working with this kind of technology"
"It could be used to supplement learning. It wouldn't be a replacement as screen based computers have videos and more ways of learning such as various apps."
"I don't think so, the expense would be too great. Robots would also need to be pitched to the receiving audience, ie not be too complicated to understand"
"They might as they could show more physical understanding of the topics than would be able to be shown through a computer screen, allowing the person using the understand more clearly "
"No this robot is too advanced "
"Yes and no. Yes it would be nice to have a robot at hand but people seem to work, and learn better with actual human interaction. "
"Absolutely, people have different learning types, and robots like this can help simplify and explain things for people who would rather look and learn from a robot rather than other alternatives. "
"Yes, it's definitely can replace current screen based computers. It's going to be better as it can demonstrate the topics that it's explaining in an entertaining engagement way."
"No it is too expensive."
"no you need human interaction as people see and understand things differently"
"No, as I don't think it is always necessary for a robot when a computer screen would give sufficient information."
"Yes it brings the explanation to life when the robot can move and describe its own actions and processes"
"I think for some people who are auditory leaners, this could be a great alternative to text based learning. That being said, as people learn in many different ways, I don't personally see robots such as this completely replacing screen based models."
"They could because they are so advanced already."
"No, because while the technology is still developing fast, people get sceptical and end of the day, humans develope robots. "
"I have no particular input on this issue. "
"Partly but I don't think they could completely replace screen based computers. They could be an excellent replacement in technical areas. Especially demonstrating physical actions."
"The words spoken by the robot were concise and  understandable. But words alone would not be an ideal teaching tool - they should be accompanied by some sort of visual aid."
"Absolutely, yes. They will be able to teach and instruct all subjects."
"yes because a lot of advancement is coming in the next 10 years."
"I'm not entirely sure. I think it would certainly help explain things because of the fact that it can express, through movements, what it's trying to explain. Like how humans use our arms etc to emphasise points. However having a screen can mean showing so much more to help visualise aspects of conversations and topics."
"I think it would take longer to adopt such technology in the workplace "
"Sure they can. They are evolving fast and will a more common form of interaction."
"I do partly believe so as some people are visual learners, and so seeing it happen in front of their eyes and described step by step may help students to learn more effectively."
"It would be too difficult to remove screens. Everyone on Earth gets their information from screens in some for and most do not trust robots."
"I very much think so. I am cautious about them replacing human workers however in AI I believe they are perfectly fit and useful.."
"Robots like this could be useful but I’d see this being way more advanced in 10 years so maybe they’d be obsolete. "
"They will to an extent, however, they will be significantly more expensive "
"Yes. By interacting with physical objects the robots represent human dynamics more easily and its operations can be more clearly understood."
"They should be able to replace screen-based systems though it is unclear about the cost involved. An 8000-dollar robot doesn't seem as useful as a 30-dollar program"
"No because that is very complicated"
"I hope not - I think it gets rid of the written words for people to read to understand topics, could be used for kinestic and auditory learners"
"Not really, this is more expensive than computers, has little value to general personal users "
"NO. I believe that being totally autonomous is against human nature, and humans want to preform tasks themselves to ensure there are no mistakes"
"yes but robots like this can also be used in conjunction with screen-based computers as i think they both have their pros and cons"
"Potentially yes as it seems a lot more interactive. "
"I think they can, but not in the time-frame. I think we're 20-30 years away from that"
"That thought really scares me. Yes, I do think they will have the capability to replace computers- but at what cost? Are robots going to phase human reliance out of existence? I don't really know a whole heck of a lot about computer vision but I know that the technological advances in robotics is astounding."
"Yes. 10 years is a long time in tech to get all the gimmicks in the right places to make robots feel more real and personal to everyone."
"No because they move too quickly "
"I think this is very possible and very exciting."
"Yes if the cost is right but I think it is an unnecessary demo that can be shown on 2D screen already "
"no, robots should not replace anything"
"No. Robots scare me. "
"yes, I think robots with replace screen based computers"
"I firmly believe that in 10 years, it will have evolved so much that it will become more human-like. Its capability will be just as good or more advanced than we can imagine."
"I do not think they could serve as a total replacement. Being able to showcase technologies like computer vision using a robot arm is more of an additional piece of equipment to help make people understand certain technologies in a more physical capacity."
"I think certain fields that require physical effort would be good areas to replace screen-based computers, however things that can be demonstrating purely through vision wouldn't be applications for robots like this"
"Yes, but I think it still needs human touch as it would be boring with only a robot"
"I don't think they could replace computers within 10 years. I think simple human input by touch/typing will still be relevant, and perhaps preferred by most people."
"While robots like this could make learning more interactive, they are unlikely to fully replace screen-based computers in the next 10 years. Computers still offer greater flexibility for complex tasks, but robots can complement education by providing hands-on experience and real-world applications."
"These robotic systems will improve hands-on education but cannot accomplish the complete replacement of screen-based computing technology during the coming decade. The use of computers represents an improved method of teaching advanced computational topics since they deliver flexible teaching approaches at reduced costs with scalable implementation for students. "
"I think it needs to be more fun if you are going to use it to teach kids.  Yes, the robot is cool, but he talks way above their level."
"Yes, if done correctly this is possible. Actually seeing something in real life making real-life movements makes teaching easier. "
"I'm not sure a robot like this one would replace screen-based computers. Computers seem much more versatile, capable of a wide range of activities related to a wide range of topics - they are more flexible to the changing needs of education, whereas this robot or similar ones seem more limited in their scope."
"Yes because it is interactive and you could ask it questions and it would answer."
"I would not think so.  This robot is just a task oriented robot and could not replace screens.  To illustrate a few tasks that robot could do and why they are doing them is good for this type of robot, but i don't think it is capable of replacing screen based computers"
"In my opinion, it really depends on the costs. If the cost is low then I don't see why this cannot be an alternative. It also depends on how effective it is for students to learn this way. "
"Probably not because the screen based computers still will be cheaper version and probably 3d hologram will be more useful than robots for educational purposes "
"To teach people how things might get repaired or put back together. "
"I don't think so. It would be too costly, and I don't think there will be enough improvement in the next 10 years where that will be necessary."
"It could be a possibility, but some learners might find it more difficult to follow as they might be visual learner and need text to follow. It could work well for a kinaesthetic learner. "
"Yes because visual learning is easier to take in and remember "
"Depends on the cost mainly. Screen based computers are probably more diverse"
"Yes, with further development I believe that this is very likely to be the case as robots will be able to explain well and clearly, including tailoring their language and complexity to people of differing abilities. "
"Probably not. Seems slightly impractical, I still think a screen will be the dominant form."
"Yes because I think hands on models would be a better teaching aid than screen based ones"
"Yes, it could save time in terms of the computer booting process "
"For some people, especially those who are vision impaired, I can see that being very useful. But in general, I can't imagine people preferring a 3D object like a robot to screens. Part of that is because we haven't replaced books with something 3D."
"Yes. They can offer hands on learning and teaching of technical concepts. "
"I think probably not, but they could help enhance learning or more probably help with engagement of certain topics. The reason for not is due to the robot being able to demonstrate one or two specific parts of a topic where a screen can essentially show you anything."
"I guess so. The explanation was a little technical and it didn't really use any visual aids in exaining how it works. I think a screen based explanation could use more visuals in the explanation to make it clearer."
"maybe i am not sure if it is practical"
"This could help in a future. The question would be how much interaction you could have with the robot to ask question and explain wording and actions. If it is possibly then this could easier flowing passage of information. Intelligence and response of the robot would be crucial. As well as adapting the style when needed."
"Potentially, depending on the advancement of robots.  I think robots can be used to teach some technical topics, but not others.  Something like playing chess makes sense, but other more serious topics may not be appropriate."
"Yes they could - BUT might be that screen or VR based alternatives will be more appropriate and lower cost?"
"I think so. While this robot's explanation could be more comprehensive, it does a good job at clearly expressing what it does."
"Not sure, I think in 10 years things will be more advanced than that"
"Yes, and there could also be humanoid robots that mimic teachers which would make it seem more natural"
"Yes as technology has been advancing very quickly"
"yes i think so because AI will become more intelligent. it already is very intelligent but will become more advanced and provide more services in line with what humans do now"
"Yes it could because this helps with the learning since in person and not on a screen"
"I am not 100% sure, but I think they could replace screen based computers or at the very least augment them. The reason being that they would be able to physically show what the robot is doing and at the same time as it is doing it. I thing using robots also can have the appearance of being more interactive as it exists in the physical world, also robots are just cool.  "
"Yes, it is possible for robots to do such - if people can adapt and get used to such a shift. Not all humans may embrace such a change, even if technologically it is feasible and well more efficient."
"Robots may enhance but won’t fully replace screens in 10 years; cost, computing power, and adaptability still favor traditional computers. "
"I think in regards to replacing computer vision I feel that it most likely will not be replaced as far as I am aware that it would be highly costly and it would require much more advanced infrastructure. Thus the benefits would out weight the costs and it was not be effective."
"Yes, this is because we are in a technology age and things are changing rapidly."
"I am not very knowledgeable on this but I believe that technologies like that develops rapidly and allows replacement of many different tools with the same or better functionality. So, yes I think it can serve as a replacement."
"Yes, only because there are a lot of health hazards to spending time on Computer screens in comparison to robots like this."
"Yes  think it could and I think this robot demonstrates it well. I also think having something move, versus just watching something on a screen is more appealing, and would lead to more visual learning."
"Yes. This is a better demonstration than an on screen computer as it shows firsthand how computer vision happens, and explains while doing so through the speaker."
"Yes they could, as they provide practical demonstrations. "
"I believe it is possible as long as there is a practical component to the teachings. "
"Hmmm, hard to say. I think screen-based computing will always prevail on a lot of things. I'd rather look at a diagram on a monitor than watch a robot draw the same diagram on a whiteboard, for example.  While the chess bot is cool, I think the concepts would be easier for me to understand, personally, if I were just reading about them on a monitor."
"I think it is possible because the robot is better at demonstrating practical aspects of a technical situation than a screen based computer is."
"I think no because children prefer to use screens and it feels like a backwards step."
"Robots can replace existing screen-based computers. They can show how to accomplish technical tasks in 3 d and will be better able to simulate real-world scenarios. "
"Yes. Because AI is gradually taking over different sectors of the world."
"Not a replacement entirely, but some times yes. It depends on what information is required."
"yes, it seems to explain things clearly, and maybe voice is more accessible for 10 year olds. It also sounds unintimidating, whereas maybe children of that age would find written instructions a bit boring and intimidating, so it may be better in that way"
"No, I do not believe, robots do not have emotions "
"Absolutely, especially with AI super intelligence, that could learn from the observers and make a tailor-made explanation that strives for maximize effectiveness in explaining the topic."
"It’s possible that robots like this could become more common as educational tools, but they are unlikely to fully replace screen-based computers. While robots can provide hands-on, interactive learning, computers offer greater flexibility for in-depth research, simulations, and large-scale accessibility. However, robots could complement traditional learning by providing a more immersive, real-world application of AI and computer vision concepts."
"possible that robots can play a bigger role but high infrastructure and maintenance costs will likely limit widespread adoption"
"I assume this question is with respect to explaining computer vision to students who want to know how it works in detail.  In my experience having a real, hands-on example of something to study is infinitely better than having a computer simulated version of it (I assume that is what ""screen-based computers refers to).  It is way more fun/exciting to be able to peek and poke at something in real life.  Having said that, In 10 year I suspect (fear?) that AI will be creating the bulk of the software in the world, including the software use in robots.  As a result I do not think that in 10 years there will be a need for a class on computer vision to educate students."
"Yes, they would be valuable in showing real-world applications of technologies."
"I DO NOT THINK THAT ROBOTS WOULD TAKE OVER COMPLETELY FROM EXISTING SCREEN COMPUTERS COS OF ETHICAL REASONS AND EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS  THAT PEOPLE HAVE CULTIVATED OVER THE YEARS. "
"Sure, providing budgets are able accommodate it. A computer screen may not be able to speak, but it is cheaper, and I know that in most learning environments, budgets can be tight. The functionality of the robot would have to justify its likely much greater price point."
"Most definitely, being able to watch in a three dimensionally is really helpful in memory and understanding a lot of things and could be adjusted to different versions of levels according to who this demo is being showed. At the same time, all in this life is not about technology and sometimes we need to exercise this ""muscle"" of our imagination and be able to grasp abstract things that makes us humans.  "
"I think there will be ways that robots can be used in preference to screens within the next 10 years, but I think that the mobility and personalization of a personal screen will be hard to replace.  There might be replacement in certain environments to assist in learning."
"no. robots cannot explain in the way a human can because robots learn differently "
"If you mean that people would asked robots with voices to explain things instead of reading about them themselves... my answer is maybe. I'm sure those will exist--the kind of do already, with Siri or Alexa, but in my experience those types of programs are less helpful than manually looking on a topic on your own and reading about it (or watching a video) to learn about something at your own pace, in a way that works best for you. It's much easier to go back if you clicked the wrong link than to wait for the robot to finish its explanation if it's talking about the wrong topic; a screen also shows you multiple options at a time, but a screenless robot can only talk about one thing from one source."
"Using robots to teach technical subjects like computer vision offers exciting potential.  Hands-on learning with robots could be more engaging and effective than screen-based methods, bridging theory and real-world applications. However, challenges include cost, complex software development, curriculum integration, accessibility, maintenance, and scalability.  While promising, widespread adoption requires addressing these hurdles."
"Not sure but scientists are working hardly to improve the quality of robots "
"yes possibly.it explains how it works which is a question lot of people have already and with the above vidieo it does that quite well"
"I am not sure if it would replace existing methods but it may be a larger alternative than it is now."
"i think so cause of how advance this robot is  it can help teach newcomers on how to adept to new technology."
"I don't think it will replace existing screen-based computers because I think it will cost too much."
"Yes I believe that is very possible! As some people tend to learn better when it is an more Hands-On experience, or when they can visually see the representation of the proper way(s) to do, and accomplish certain tasks, problems, & experiments! This is all of course if within the next 10 years we do make some prominent advances in ai and it being able to work with physical robot in-pairs without negative side effects so to speak."
"As fast as AI is improving and evolving, I can see this happening in the next ten years if we put in the certain parameters to control it. We don't need any rogue A.I."
"Maybe, but I find the voice to be irritating. I prefer more humanlike voices where the intonation and cadence is more natural."
"I’m not sure, it depends on the practical usage. This particular robot seems to have a very specialised knowledge, whereas a screen based computer does many different things."
"I think it may be able to replace. It's good to be able to see and understand things with a 3d model. It makes visualization much easier. I think it is also more entertaining to watch"
"yes as Instead of passively reading or watching videos, you could engage in interactive conversations. "
"Yes definitely. In 10 years time robots would be cheaper to get and place in classroooms and wil be much more engaging for students to learn from it.  "
"Yes as technology advances I believe there will be a market for this type of computer based replacement. "
"probably yes. i think it will be very useful for physical demonstrations of concepts"
"Maybe, they look to be able to work out what is in front of them better."
"Not sure that this can replace computers"
"Could be, why not? Within 10 years robot quality might be really good, and the boom in AI could probably spurs the investment and development in robotic fields. "
"No, they are too bulky"
