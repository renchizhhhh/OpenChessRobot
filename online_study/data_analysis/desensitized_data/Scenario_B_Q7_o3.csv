R_5J8uHvrhM4sRIjL,Definitely. It is more in depth and visual.,positive
R_7EbCXnJ4ZDFVQc9,"Yes I think robots like this one could replace existing screen-based computers. The physical board may be prefered among players rather than a digital version. Additionally, seeing the robot move the pieces may be more efficient for the player's memory, but I am not sure. ",positive
R_80Deztc9VK2oTCx,"No, because these robots are quite expensive and fragile compared to a standard computer.",negative
R_33SUIxyiGzpmoxP,I hope not. I am not pro AI being implemented into everyday life.,negative
R_1qmWoMHnhpce1bX,"I think that's too early, and it would be too expensive. We'd use other less expensive methods, like a video. ",negative
R_51Es4U6LJcbQWhM,No. It is too expensive and usually only serves a couple purposes. why would I want  a chess robot over a Ipad that can do the same and everyone else.,negative
R_1JQRZU3IUsIYnAP,I don't see anything that this adds to a computer based model that a human wouldn't do better. It seems like everything required could either be done by a screen based computer or an actual person.,negative
R_8TKWbdjs1BjkQPT,"yes, bcus someone will code em better, and teach better",positive
R_3zkznt2o2YAdllz,not replace... computers can go with you anywhere.  They are more handy.,negative
R_5Pmwq7vssQGs3pT,"Probably not. While the robot is interesting and may have its uses, computers are already widely available and convenient. This robot is specialized to do just one thing, while a computer is good for many.",negative
R_1KJwoPhrvDV9I7h,"Within 10 years, robots like this could complement but not fully replace screen-based computers for improving chess skills, as digital platforms offer faster analysis and deeper strategic insights. However, advancements in AI and robotics could make physical chess-playing robots more interactive and engaging, especially for education and hands-on learning experiences.",negative
R_5pbSouhp2lQRoAz,"Yes. The field is really coming up. It is very likely that we will even own then in our homes, having to require license for one.",positive
R_2n7zbZ0dxZe7WWJ,I believe it can work with a human interaction. I believe the place of human interaction should not be removed to learn chess,neutral
R_3WD9kgiVjiRbrBb,"Perhaps. I am not sure the verbal instructions alone are as good as the visual with diagrams. On the other hand, there is value in looking at the board in the normal way. ",neutral
R_5AYgz9TDrPz9qSx,I don't like the idea because of the above reasons.,negative
R_1PGpJv96shLKo9Z,I'm not sure. It would depend upon how well they could receive and respond to user input.,neutral
R_7hV5bLoDxMywnT3,Yes everything will be replaced with robots. it's more convenient,positive
R_7GExcqjqR9o8GEV,yes because they programmed and can easily manipulate task,positive
R_7ozEdxpdsEyvHe8,"yes, they can be helpful and informative especially one like this the shows you and explains exactly why its moving each piece. ",positive
R_60SZapCmxWTOWUK,It would definitely be something cool but at the same time I don't really think it's necessary,negative
R_295RNulztjFOsQF,I think that the point of chess is that humans enjoy it so using a robot takes the human aspect away from the game,negative
R_6s0SofpwI1wbimM,yes I think so. I think you can artificially grab people's attention and teach them with human aspects like intonation and tone.,positive
R_7C2cBvCyGVoD47k,I'm not sure maybe if there was like a fully AI robot that you could hang out with everyday but if it's just for chess then I don't see the big demand for that,neutral
R_77m3JC9Wm0RSkWi,"I don't think so, as I think that screen based computers are much cheaper and effective as tools for learning, such as chess.com and Lichess",negative
R_1thXWKTbm2VM6Nz,"If they were improved to be engaging, yes. ",positive
R_5v8LOOyZFrPv63D,They could but I do not see the practicality of it. The model as it is seems bulky and inconvenient.,negative
R_256cMob4B7HLh73,"I do, improvements will be made in robotics. The ai is pretty much already there",positive
R_2YzjrkxZ8C2T8ya,"Depending on funding it is possible, and could be more engaging. However practicalities and space would be a factor which could hinder this happening also screens are easily visible where as the view of a robot could be obstructed.",neutral
R_7fIXN2kpxFjVOmo,"Depends, just not with genAI",neutral
R_8QAZzcL2kVJLXGl,"100%, AI is the way forward and the way its implemented here to play chess and explain chess moves it'll make teaching and learning chess a lot simpler.",positive
R_2KydrIlGL2aRxHE,"I'm not sure, the robot would need to have been developed much more",neutral
R_61dTfRWIMarMxO1,yes.  it would be easier to learn from a robot like this then just a computer screen,positive
R_7pRJz136MNKmZ2h,I think human teachers will be replaced by robots. This is because they cost less.,positive
R_81jJUzSLXzKf4Ne,For something like chess that is a good idea.  Not for lessons though.,positive
R_7oGR3mS9kZLlwMc,No because they are probably more expensive than just using programming on the computer to teach chess,negative
R_1bUGS952920UxiA,Probably. That's where society seems to be headed.,positive
R_7PdsR2d8EtLAd3u,possibly if they can converse a bit bitter.,neutral
R_8vm1qM6iVvMAaSl,"Yes, robots like this allow for more versatile styles of teaching and (especially as time goes on) further development for both the designers and the users. ",positive
R_5a62Q9L08jC2EJr,"No, it is so much more convenient to just play with a screen based computer and it is so interactive and easy.",negative
R_8BAJnL1Iv5aDgfD,Probably not just because of the cost.,negative
R_8S4xJTnTdqgJNQt,No. Screen-based is still going to be cheaper - it's multi-purpose whereas the robot (as it stands) only has a single job. Dedicated kit is always more expensive. There are no real advantages to the robot other than novelty value.,negative
R_2vjiQ5DEgz9epqx,I think they could serve as a replacement because a lot of people learn better with a physical hands on approach,positive
R_8NQaogNEgdWH9as,"I think AI/robots could serve as a replacement as AI bots such as stockfish allow moves to be calculated faster and with sound reasoning, and giving in-depth explanations while also showing other possible valuable moves.",positive
R_87dSKxvjyqHDpU7,it's a lot of equipment but i guess it helps visualise it better if a robot is moving in real life.,positive
R_80jjHLSQ3Hq2Sn3,no as it wont ever be able to fully be true,negative
R_8kHectvnApXOlvM,If the technology becomes cheaper and it becomes more popular then yes however a screen is very convenient,neutral
R_5GQCFQLs2f8JSf1,If you already have a robot to do other things then yes but no one is going to buy a robot to just play chess when you can just go online and play for free.,negative
R_8Sl4DfNhlfWzeK4,I think chess is a complex game and robots and AI could function well in helping learners especially beginners as it's able to talk through the steps,positive
R_20q0nn1sHJYamyw,"Maybe, depending on how far the robot development will go. ",neutral
R_3xzXggFb8gnmA7f,"Maybe within 10 years. It provides real, tactical game play which many may find beneficial, however I feel at this time it is not nuanced enough. ",neutral
R_8RV73S0CyAHvWaf,"No, it is too noisy and too cumbersome. It is also far less portable.",negative
R_84l9p6dXPLiibyK,No. I think the cost of the robots could be prohibitive. I also dont see robots becoming more popular as they seem unnecessarily bulky,negative
R_8cd9h43Fi1IRn0x,"It's hard to say it would be an improvement, as it is essentially a 3D version of an already existing feature, and having played a chess software in the past, it is hard for the human player to learn from their mistakes. Especially as there is no human element of ""mistake"". However it does seem like a friendlier approach than a 2D computer software, and if given more human elemants, could be an improvement.",neutral
R_5OH5BJT4hGUumjt,"Probably not - computers can be anywhere, including our homes. Something like this would have to be gone to.",negative
R_6trjDhfuuqQ6Dkt,"No, they offer little more than current. ",negative
R_5sdNem1ZBQi5Tgm,"Yes, seems to be going in that direction. ",positive
R_8G7PFWlYbalcCiJ,"yes definitely, I cant see why not, if humans give them the knowledge they can be better  .",positive
R_8ivPgZUm8yYYiAw,"Maybe for players who are in a full club or something, but learning from home, no. The ease of a video by a simple search will always be easier than having to buy a robot specifically to learn chess.",negative
R_7a8g7bmJvvNd3p1,"Yes, but I'm not sure it's necessary to remove screen-based computers. The teaching aspect could work the same without a physical robot and chess board. If it did other things as well as chess I could see how that might be better.",neutral
R_2kIaGdeMjy0XoxJ,"Yes, because you can physically see what it is doing on a real life chess board, it shows how the game would physically be played ",positive
R_1kB3t6juYRaKDqD,"yes, since it's just replacing one robot to another robot ",positive
R_2PALTK7BM4F5H6e,"I could definitely see robots like this serving as replacements to improve chess skills, when I have played against the computer in chess, there is no explanation and movements are done instantaneously. ",positive
R_2eXz8jSqGsZnmdW,it could as technology is fast evolving,positive
R_2wkwJs6k8DXKCiZ,"Not really, no, barriers to entry are very high for a robot of this sort, whereas for screen-based computers it's close to non existent as nearly everyone already has one.",negative
R_88Ai1Ll9i77p3YR,"I do not think so. Why i said so is because it might be expensive to maintain or get so, not many people might not be able to afford it. But, we do not know what the future may bring.",negative
R_5rjFMfjqBDDWk4J,"Probably not fully. Screens offer more accessibility and analysis tools, but robots could complement learning by making it more interactive.        ",negative
R_5zZnxLMm5gTmCha,i would imagine so because the lessons would be given on a real board rather than onscreen,positive
R_8mKkGlKda02v0Bu,"I think it would be very expensive to implement these robots, even in 10 years when they're inevitably cheaper. It's easier for people to pick up a computer and start learning chess than to find a robot like this to play with them. However, I think it would be able to improve quickly as it performs more matches and gains more varied training data.",negative
R_4mEq9Jfymd2aSu4,"Yes, the use of the robot is more realistic and you can see it live in action. It's more interactive that screen based options.",positive
R_20JJo0rEt4h96Qs,"depends on what the user wants.  If they want to learn a home, then probably no.  If they want to learn in a different environment, then possibly yes. ",neutral
R_82wXXYU2vK4TqUh,I think they could just because it's a lot easier for robots like this to generate ideas and explanations than an existing screen based computer can,positive
R_3OIUMZPak1rWUaU,Maybe because it is more practical to have the robot in front of you for learning.,neutral
R_6QMoGIDt4vMmuWi,"If we have a humanoid robot, probably yes and we can set up a one on one lesson for students as and when needed.",positive
R_2eTLUYvDnefiNZD,"No, a piece of software running on a screen will be more cost effective and more versatile, ie the same computer that you run your chess program on can also do other things.",negative
R_8bQbR6NMNCYlyA9,"Yes, if the robot is planted well there?s a chance it could serve as a replacement which means it would Make learning the chess easier and faster",positive
R_2rcNW5hPeDlF1Cd,yes. we tend to learn better when seeing something real.,positive
R_6DZP0FllHylG3c6,Yes. It?s inevitable. And they can show exactly what the move looks like on the board. ,positive
R_2HkRWxYtXZbQQw4,"no, they are expensive and not avaliable to the average person",negative
R_3E0JA91AB8cQB4e,"yes and no, it may just be significantly costly. Doesn't necessarily improve on what is already out there as far as on screen based computers. ",neutral
R_279XLEE08mj4Fgt,They definitely could. I think money will obviously be a huge factor but in community centres / schools I dont see why not.,positive
R_2IQTCJABeGsZk69,i don?t think it?s necessary- does the same as stock fish or any other engine just a bit bulkier,negative
R_2BzJvpBVVEtsFuU,Possibly. I imagine this would be an expensive investment to replace current computers.,neutral
R_6oCq0z119Rlj4so,"i prefer robots than computers personally, i do not like to stare at screen too long. and actual chess could help me concentrate more ",positive
R_2Mslwr0yHE2jb0t,I think robots would be used to replace existing computers as they are less stressful to handle and work on their own,positive
R_65KfUmUiarHq2RZ,"possibly? im not sure the investment is immediately worth it, as it doesnt seem to solve much of a problem that video with narration may have. ",neutral
R_5veHTaLqtxoTzBD,I don't think it can replace humans completely but since it's based on logic and skill they would learn easily. Just without a human touch,neutral
R_3r00YMfvKorcXC5,Absolutely not it wouldn?t be fair and it will take the four hour playing chess when it should be a regular board game with regular people,negative
R_8duB66xog5TTzTJ,Yes it would be more interesting than using screens,positive
R_4NaWwBnSYHEO44n,"No. I think more people play chess online (digitally) these days and digital/computer chess would be superior because you have more teaching aids. For instance, you would be able to show potential moves on the board with visual aids instead of just talking about them.",negative
R_2rN4MQPM6lEFNXK,"Yes, it?s much more interactive than screen based learning, especially for those who learn by action.",positive
R_2jDMsLTPUoBKefP,"Absolutely. If the price is right I think they could do a very good job at replacing computers, to make things feel far more physical",positive
R_7Bvn53DRUL8jCH7,"Yes, i think robots will much more integrated and realistic.",positive
R_4rIlAi58LTU86Vl,"Assuming you mean that the robot being filmed could replace screen-based computers, yes. If you're talking about actual robots, the resources required to build and ship them would be enormous and not necessarily the best use of finite resources.",neutral
R_19OGNf2KjdlZ345,"Potentially, it eliminate sthe boring virtual atmosphere and makes it more interactive.",positive
R_6sYyVlLhG4zivNk,I guess it can.  Never gave it much thought.,neutral
R_82z7P5pdPBdQNfm,"Yes I guess so. Although I'm not a fan of robots in a classroom environment,  I think with a game scenario it could work well",positive
R_62Xj6NVSYKBrPpt,"I think so. Robots/AI are the way of the future, so I don't think chess would be excluded from that.",positive
R_2zLJRDxrZJ2vGIw,Maybe as it has a lot of knowledge,neutral
R_2zIlo1WqrRdEgRH,"Hard to say. But both are run by software/ai. So is the robot even necessary? A screen based computer will go through the exact moves so I do not think, based on this fact that robots like this will replace computers.",negative
R_80jUEeJBKIUuejM,A robot wouldn't be able to think like a human,negative
R_67vxHBwE3noRL3L,"It could but I don't see how it would be practical. Computer based chess programs are cheap, can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms, and are already quite advanced from a technical standpoint. The robot by comparison likely will not compete on price and have little to no use outside of teaching chess.",negative
R_2flGXlDTqiBltND,"I don?t see why not, they explain everything and unlike humans you can?t argue with robots.",positive
R_5HT75J4iPtDbVTV,Absolutely. If someone is more of a hands on learner this approach to teaching would be ideal. ,positive
R_5e2F8T8LtRR6044,"Not sure, one thing is playing against a robot, the other is learning. The human element is always helpful for learning. ",neutral
R_2DXR9Cfab2S5Wwu,I think robots can help teachers in class as an assistant but the robot cannot replace teachers them selves because it does not look serious.,negative
R_6EBaNsH85uiWNKx,"No, I would prefer to watch a person teaching how to play, using common regular words, not so robotic speaking.",negative
R_1CKF57SkvbWhFPg,"it could but having reset or going back a few moves, or showing different outcomes will still be easy on the computer",neutral
R_2sYbdmGorjXQQ4J,Yes and no. Yes - as some students benefit from learning watching a demonstration. No - the screen-based computer could be advantageous if it has interactive features e.g. specific placements on the board. I think it depends on the way in which someone learns.,neutral
R_6i2pn4IWXr9qqDo,"yes because chess is a game of rules and a robot could explain every move a human isnt even necessary due to the limitations of chess theres no freedom of expression, its all moves that every body knows already.",positive
R_22hvEi0o9sNQjPI,"Takes up too much space, and cannot be used remotely. I dont think it would serve as a replacement but as an alternative. ",negative
R_80nMekUcyui4TZL,They could but the use and production of these robots will be very expensive and too expensive for the average person.,negative
R_13kDkWm77hDXRdT,It can replace existing screen based computers because it is AI backed but also it will not be fun because it's too predictive.,positive
R_4q7LdYmlooFmcvh,Definitely not within 10 years as the cost associated with robots such as these will be much greater than the existing screen-based computers.,negative
R_7fQ38iuwAa0QHPu,"Absolutely. Just as chess itself was easy to digitize for simpler computers and programs, it fits well with new technology (AI) and robotic capabilities.",positive
R_74dDo4vhxK8dhfJ,i dont't think the manipulations on the board are necessary to learn,negative
R_28MbrvitCuDqsRK,I am unsure as to whether they could replace computers,neutral
R_8JIXPiwrTAf4ava,"Why Robots Could Gain Popularity 	1.	Tactile and Physical Engagement ? Many players prefer physical chessboards over digital screens. A robot that moves pieces and provides real-time coaching could offer a more immersive experience. 	2.	Better for Young Learners ? Interactive robots could help children stay engaged and reduce screen time while learning chess. 	3.	AI and Adaptive Learning ? Future robots will likely have stronger AI with personalized coaching, similar to Chess.com or Lichess, but in a real-world setting. 	4.	Classroom and Group Use ? Robots could be useful for schools and chess clubs where multiple students can observe and interact without needing individual devices.  Why Screens Won?t Be Fully Replaced 	1.	Versatility of Screens ? Chess apps allow for online play, advanced analysis, and access to massive databases of games, which a robot may struggle to replicate. 	2.	Cost and Accessibility ? High-quality chess robots with AI coaching would be expensive, whereas chess software on a tablet or PC is widely accessible. 	3.	Portability and Convenience ? A chess app on a phone or laptop is more convenient for learning and playing anywhere, unlike a physical robot. 	",neutral
R_23ZVxWqUKSrfDOo,"i think it?s open to either way, screen based could be more simple and accessible and ?quick? whereas robots would be for more extensive teaching and actually being able to visualise the board physically which can be benefitial.",neutral
R_7ef8mgsmZgDMXSR,I think it might be possible but there are pros and cons. If there is a malfunction or if the input provided is wrong then the output will also be wrong and can misguide people. I think there would need to be continuous observation of the robot and assessment of whether it is functioning properly and providing accurate information.,neutral
R_544kr69KL5XmMnv,Some people do enjoy the company of people while playing a competitive game but the majority of gamers prefer a screen based game so I don't think this robot will fully replace it.,negative
R_8hc1QSdrr7qNB2M,yes. Its being built with required knowledge ,positive
R_43xnPUDIzs5UFtk,"Absolutely, real world experience is more valuable and the commentary, and ability to ask it questions will aid learning for different students with different levels of need.",positive
R_2TYwgLdFvo17Cr2,yes i think there is a possibility of this happening in the nearest future,positive
R_84O6XFfrNVijZ7z,I think people will still want to play on personal devices or consoles rather than physically against a robot,negative
R_7tGrP60fLLUdve5,"I think for chess it's absolutely possible. For a game that is based on problem solving and quick thinking, a robot can absolutely get the job done. ",positive
R_1OuD9B2aVMvzl6y,"I don't see the cost coming down enough within 10 years for most people and institutions to justify getting a robot like this. Maybe it will exist at some or most universities, but I don't see any grade schools implementing something like this anytime soon. Furthermore, a computer will use the same AI so many people will see no point in getting a robot like this, especially because many AI voice agents are in development.",negative
R_2UBGZx6nCK3Mda1,yes because they will be programme on the commonly FAQs and might be to answer neccesary questions.,positive
R_8ARwzzqhePmpiU2,"probably yes, as A1 can learn data etc. so it would be able to learn rules of chess.",positive
R_7Ca4kXhHNpWaLI0,"Yes, I think robots will improve skills",positive
R_4FJozkt6yM1dy6E,I think it would be an interesting tool. But it does seem a little elaborate (and expensive) for the ease of a computer making movements. ,neutral
R_30enTHfRetujlby,No; I think playing chess against any opponent is the way to improve chess skills. I do not think it matters if an AI opponent has a screen or not.,negative
R_21jipFCVUzlyBk4,"Possibly, it depends on the age of the children being taught, ie being distracted by the movements of the robot and not listening",neutral
R_23fqE7p9Pqwcmht, thats time its not available  its came right now,negative
R_18CYBF0mJ6G0eKz,"I think they could, but I'm not sure how likely it is in every context. Something like this seems really expensive, which not many public schools could afford. Also, there would need to be more data on how much more helpful it is than existing computers, in order to justify the expense. It's certainly possible, but it doesn't seem likely to me. ",negative
R_7DJChpilD4WBrJ7,"Yes, I think they are somewhat more interactive than a computer screen.  I think people would resonate more with a robot.",positive
R_9OlbKkfyA3JYW9P,It most likely even if you don?t want due to how fast the technology changing,positive
R_2K3fZZX056phOhz,Hard to say but I doubt it as a screen-based computer has a multitude of functionalities beyond just chess coaching and would perhaps be more useful in a school environment,negative
R_1sbVAEKsoeaucsP,"I think they could, it seemed to be very helpful. They know the exact moves and what?s happening on the board ",positive
R_4DZ0SwgcPoLSPob,"50/50. I think this could be a very good learning tool provided to novice players and professional, but I think at the end of the day chess comes down to skillset in which a human can provide to eventually win a game of chess however this could be beneficial for providing new techniques/strategies.",neutral
R_8HSJGxWGMdqPBYd,Yes definitely as it?s actually doing the moves in real life,positive
R_5gGRaALZjWAc6rf,"I think computers may still be more affordable, as many of us already own one, it might be more practical to improve chess skills by simply using a gpt to help practice, or some other AI based software that could help players practice on screen, so this type of robot may not be necessary. ",negative
R_2M0dicBc3VqO8uf,"Yes, to an extent! It think an interactive approach toward learning is always better than just watching things on screens. However, not all learning material can be taught using robots.    ",positive
R_3xRZ4NtFqII38bg,"No, I don?t believe the average person will be able to access these types of robots in 10 years. Most people do have computers however.",negative
R_8qkgMxtw3k4rIpH,"I think so, it is more engaging, especially if the user could be the second player and be taught in-person this way.",positive
R_31TvfwohANbhw8q,In my opnion it depends on what they think like people but yes i think they do this,positive
R_6YXPkMzQ1eSkWuB,Yes I believe they could replace screen based computers because with improvements this robot could teach more technical skills in the best way possible with real time movements and explanations of those movements.,positive
R_6dG1K2jzV9se34u,I think it is a possibility. But I fear for future teachers when I see this.,neutral
R_6dj3cOfND0W33eB,"Maybe.  Honestly, it largely depends on the cost.  There are so many, many chess tools available online that are completely free.  If someone had to pay for this robot, why would they when there are so many resources that don't cost anything?  Ultimately it all comes down to how readily accessible these are.  ",neutral
R_8Cki7GpXEIci8NT,"Yes, I think with the huge advancements in AI it is very possible and the robot in the video is already doing a great job.",positive
R_7ozdVWPJhM5LvPz,"Potentially - The benefits of screens based computers is definitely the accessibility. Having a robotic arm teach chess, while definitely a novel idea, does not provide any additional benefit to actually learning chess over a computer.",negative
R_6LSeev8X0ykhxS6,"yes, AI getting better and smarter ",positive
R_4nfnwzkVMZpIumC,At places like schools or chess clubs yes. For learning at home not a chance they would be too expensive to replace a simple computer based ai.,neutral
R_7incRtwkTMI5DeK,Yes. I think this robot could teach chess better than screen-based computers if it can be asked questions and give detailed factual answers. And it can show a more hands on approach with students. ,positive
R_1ifEIt6S98Rj7sC,No I don't think it's very feasible. Every classroom would have to have a robot. Where they already have screens which is easier to boot up and watch. ,negative
R_5v0JfEUOuMud7ph,"Maybe in the narrow sense in which it might improve over-the-board chess, but screen-based computers will likely still be the best way to do things, as they don't have the added latency of physically moving pieces.",neutral
R_2gBgh1zh135ctbV,No screen based are far more convenient and take up far less room.,negative
R_8OTLMh8JaB0XjD6,"Yes they could replace screen based computers. It's more engaging playing with the robot on a physical board, rather than screen based ",positive
R_2lbJ7Wy3nGLbmMn,"definitely, if the robots are skilled up knowing the most common chess algorithms to win it'll be harder for opponents to win",positive
R_2ONlD0oX7HFe8qP,Yes - I see nothing the screen based computers are doing that this is not.,positive
R_1JbaXDoxh6AKNVZ,"I think robots will take over just about everything and replace us with robots, which could be good and in other ways bad for us, because we will depend on them to much.",neutral
R_6AGwkQ7YF8QddUu,"I think it could be used as a replacement but I don't think it would completely replace screen-based computers. However, the price might be too high to replace screen-based computers completely. ",neutral
R_2CDu3O8TwNgAheP,Potentially because it feels more like a real player in front of you and it offers you a chance to practise skills. ,positive
R_3irIMsWwCExz0W2,Maybe not a total replacement. But it could be a significant tool. The robot is pretty expensive and takes up a lot of space. Screen-based computers serve many functions. The robot would need to have more uses.,neutral
R_1disSmMcyIcETHQ,"Yes. I believe this robot does a much better job of showing the chess strategies in a 3D space, rather than in a 2D board on a computer screen. Seeing the chess strategies in a real environment in my opinion is more effective on teaching children how to recognize chess strategies while also learning new ones. Lastly, the robot is almost like having a real teacher in the room, which I believe is vastly superior for a learning experience instead of having the children listen to computer audio while staring at a computer screen. ",positive
R_8SqOEs0sfvBDoQH,"no, I think screen based chess is faster and more accurate currently and also preferred by players.",negative
R_8NrAAq2xt9ZyWeZ,Yes I do. The robot provides good explanations for each move and can be used to improve and teach chess skills.,positive
R_2CQaCP9aQjaKAaK,I think it could definitely replace those services as it likely gives similar information but presents it in an easier to understand way as the person learning is able to see the movements in real life. The cost could be a prohibitive factor in replacing pre-existing services as a physical object like this would be far more expensive.,positive
R_8gBJsRLGo7bkr85,"Potentially they will work for some people but like all learning, people earn in different ways ",neutral
R_54fayvdTk11jPoy,"I?m not sure, I don?t know enough about chess",neutral
R_2q8KRW6z4U8rM1K,"Yes, in theory, although I find it unlikely that the average person would be able to afford one and/or have the requisite space + power + computing requirements to have one in their home. For personal use I would presume screen-based computers would largely remain. Additionally, having a loudly talking robot seems a little unnecessary for teaching chess and may not be desirable in situations where more private/individual study is required (or simply desired).

R_6VrDez8DDOBSmn7,I think in certain places yes. Like research fields and for specific learning but I dont think itll replace the every day computers we use now. ,neutral
R_80o8rchxJlxKx5n,"I think they can supplement chess learning, but I don't think they will replace screen based computers as they are not as accessible.",negative
R_8CeSUPSYbb9U5QC,"Yes I can see their use in 10 years to replace screens, maybe sooner it technology allows",positive
R_1FkyHNKN4Hjm8SS,"I thinks so. They can learn which part people may have hard time to understand, so they can explain more specifically.",positive
R_3fxUWqRawVA6DVT,I think so. It is more interactive.,positive
R_1owmEbks7QItSX2,"Yes, because this is much more immersive (three dimensions!) than a computer screen.",positive
R_8lMc7B8tRApNRD3,Maybe - I think it could help some learners who are more practical and tactile learners.,neutral
R_2dHaUnJWcXC3105,"I think this could be an option however, a simple program can probably teach the same things while being far less expensive and more accessible to most.",neutral
R_2k1FWeKstaYwmwO,"It's fine, but surely a screen-based system would be cheaper and able to be implemented much more widely. It's nice as a demo item, but not practical.",negative
R_8KSByQ7nj4nX4UH,"This is possible as they may give a more 'hands-on' learning experience. But the cost of such a robot would be expensive compared with the costs of running computer based programmes, so I'm not sure many chess teachers would support their widespread use.",neutral
R_8PfmdhsLNU2Waqd,"Yes, I believe with machine learning robots could absolutely serve as a replacement ",positive
R_5170IxzMVySbbfY,"While possible, due to a robot having a physical interaction, thus making it likely more engaging than a screen-based computer, it would still lack the play speed of a screen-based computer as well as wouldn't be able to visually display arrows and variations as effectively, while also probably being a much higher cost to produce and implement than screen-based computers.",negative
R_1mygiVnsvnfzYBG,I don't think they can serve as a replacement unless big improvements are made.  The robots are not very human like.,negative
R_2dF4Sd87lNBrRuZ,"Potentially yes, if they were to explain how and why they?re making the moves they are doing",positive
R_5m2MSvphjNA0vfj,"Yes, it?s visually appealing ",positive
R_2PU0e4rqsrlKK9H,"Absolutely, sometimes it?s not as easy being on a computer but physically seeing a robot move and why it?s moving there I think is brilliant ",positive
R_2arj0nNO9q5nguw,Possibly but I can't see there being too much value added here unless it's more reactive,neutral
R_8bV30ixbJwGcVPv,"Yes, perhaps so, particularly if the robot is a little livelier. I think the use of something physical can help people to engage all the more. If it's a robot like this that can point out a method via actual movement of the pieces on a 3D board rather than just something someone is interacting with on-screen. That said, I can imagine that the latter would be sufficient for some users. Particularly those who've played a fair bit of chess already and want a speedier way of observing/learning. I imagine with the AI use, one could also ask the robot to show something again/differently/or ask a question about one of the methods discussed.",positive
R_3YKYRTAAudWRaH3,Nothing at all............,negative
R_3neKTqklEw8077r,"Yes, it could happen, as it could serve as another player or some type of tutor, someone you can learn from playing, which you can't really replicate or do in the same way on screen-based computers.",positive
R_2CAXvOZclUnhkg5,"No. Not a replacement. Robots could be another source of learning but they will not replace screeen based systems because they are not easily portable and they are likely to be expensive. A simple screen based system, even an app, is cheap and convenient.",negative
R_8Lil2JAe65ofPka,Yes! this is much more visual and realistic!,positive
R_2FkMa3exvAElUQb,"Again, I think the expense is far to high for a simple game procedure.",negative
R_8THGToN58NR6pBU,"Yes, If there's an improvement over time. ",positive
R_4NvNuKocRkisW9K,"I think it provides a more interactive way of learning, people would be more engaged and more likely to learn with a hands on experience than a screen. Cost might be a factor as it is most likely expensive compared to a tablet or computer. ",positive
R_1efVMveFQleVFiq,"Yes, I do think this will be a replacement in some capacity. I believe this more ""hands-on"" approach serves to help many students learn more effectively. I believe the cost will be a huge barrier to the full replacement of screen-based learning, however. ",positive
R_3effLHLpIa8DsS6,"Of course, technology has come to replace computers, cell phones and even people.",positive
R_6iKeCT50peQs9Lf,"Very much so, that seems like a probable outcome given that AI functions like ChatGPT aids students in learning. Chess is a game of logic so a robot could replace screen-based computers and add value in demonstrating where to move the chess pieces. ",positive
R_7n0YAlUNpn9XSsc,Learning a variety of games is likely to make fewer mistakes than a human playing chess.,neutral
R_6zhJujjkQdtrhpT,"I don't think a physical robot will be needed, it's much easier and simpler to have AI integrated in some digital format where the user can interact with some interface and have an AI assistant explaining moves like done in the video.",negative
R_6nxgtsv4zEeZ3EH,"yes. in ten years to come,robot will be more advanced",positive
R_1V7NdmfTI9tmtBN,"I don't think they will replace them, but I think they could become more popular. It would still take a long time to fine tune all of the uses of the robot and to encourage people to switch to the new technology.",negative
R_7gNSth5y2PrzjHg,"It depends on how more intelligent they will become, more like a human ",neutral
R_2BtUkqKxKLbdAaX,i think so because the robot is explaing with pratical and with the way AI is going the robot can replace existing based computers,positive
R_7HzPI87ILy3LO0H,"Robots are able to analyze data better than humans, so it would seem likely they could engage in lessons professionally and properly. ",positive
R_2kumFR7bXoo5k2J,No. Definitely not. Robots are invading society.,negative
R_3GK9MAuCRSp8GkS,Yes and i say that because it would become something normal,positive
R_8cUBTXrjeEqbwfD,"They could be effective because it was more realistic to have them move the pieces on the board, rather than simply watching a digital board on a screen.",positive
R_8Hk1ZYuWBC6z3dF,"No, they can seem intimidating to those who do not have regular exposure to them.",negative
R_2ozlRcIZoDwzO38,Yes I  believe that in ten years time the Robot  could replace exist existing screen based computrr,positive
R_41lLSiE3YjXdIad,Definitely possible to replace existing as it give a person a real life chance again someone as practice without the need for humans  ,positive
