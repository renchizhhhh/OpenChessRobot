Definitely. It is more in depth and visual.,positive
"Yes I think robots like this one could replace existing screen-based computers. The physical board may be prefered among players rather than a digital version. Additionally, seeing the robot move the pieces may be more efficient for the player's memory, but I am not sure. ",positive
"No, because these robots are quite expensive and fragile compared to a standard computer.",negative
I hope not. I am not pro AI being implemented into everyday life.,negative
"I think that's too early, and it would be too expensive. We'd use other less expensive methods, like a video. ",negative
No. It is too expensive and usually only serves a couple purposes. why would I want  a chess robot over a Ipad that can do the same and everyone else.,negative
I don't see anything that this adds to a computer based model that a human wouldn't do better. It seems like everything required could either be done by a screen based computer or an actual person.,negative
"yes, bcus someone will code em better, and teach better",positive
not replace... computers can go with you anywhere.  They are more handy.,negative
"Probably not. While the robot is interesting and may have its uses, computers are already widely available and convenient. This robot is specialized to do just one thing, while a computer is good for many.",negative
"Within 10 years, robots like this could complement but not fully replace screen-based computers for improving chess skills, as digital platforms offer faster analysis and deeper strategic insights. However, advancements in AI and robotics could make physical chess-playing robots more interactive and engaging, especially for education and hands-on learning experiences.",negative
"Yes. The field is really coming up. It is very likely that we will even own then in our homes, having to require license for one.",positive
I believe it can work with a human interaction. I believe the place of human interaction should not be removed to learn chess,neutral
"Perhaps. I am not sure the verbal instructions alone are as good as the visual with diagrams. On the other hand, there is value in looking at the board in the normal way. ",neutral
I don't like the idea because of the above reasons.,negative
I'm not sure. It would depend upon how well they could receive and respond to user input.,neutral
Yes everything will be replaced with robots. it's more convenient,positive
yes because they programmed and can easily manipulate task,positive
"yes, they can be helpful and informative especially one like this the shows you and explains exactly why its moving each piece. ",positive
It would definitely be something cool but at the same time I don't really think it's necessary,negative
I think that the point of chess is that humans enjoy it so using a robot takes the human aspect away from the game,negative
yes I think so. I think you can artificially grab people's attention and teach them with human aspects like intonation and tone.,positive
I'm not sure maybe if there was like a fully AI robot that you could hang out with everyday but if it's just for chess then I don't see the big demand for that,neutral
"I don't think so, as I think that screen based computers are much cheaper and effective as tools for learning, such as chess.com and Lichess",negative
"If they were improved to be engaging, yes. ",positive
They could but I do not see the practicality of it. The model as it is seems bulky and inconvenient.,negative
"I do, improvements will be made in robotics. The ai is pretty much already there",positive
"Depending on funding it is possible, and could be more engaging. However practicalities and space would be a factor which could hinder this happening also screens are easily visible where as the view of a robot could be obstructed.",neutral
"Depends, just not with genAI",neutral
"100%, AI is the way forward and the way its implemented here to play chess and explain chess moves it'll make teaching and learning chess a lot simpler.",positive
"I'm not sure, the robot would need to have been developed much more",neutral
yes.  it would be easier to learn from a robot like this then just a computer screen,positive
I think human teachers will be replaced by robots. This is because they cost less.,positive
For something like chess that is a good idea.  Not for lessons though.,positive
No because they are probably more expensive than just using programming on the computer to teach chess,negative
Probably. That's where society seems to be headed.,positive
possibly if they can converse a bit bitter.,neutral
"Yes, robots like this allow for more versatile styles of teaching and (especially as time goes on) further development for both the designers and the users. ",positive
"No, it is so much more convenient to just play with a screen based computer and it is so interactive and easy.",negative
Probably not just because of the cost.,negative
No. Screen-based is still going to be cheaper - it's multi-purpose whereas the robot (as it stands) only has a single job. Dedicated kit is always more expensive. There are no real advantages to the robot other than novelty value.,negative
I think they could serve as a replacement because a lot of people learn better with a physical hands on approach,positive
"I think AI/robots could serve as a replacement as AI bots such as stockfish allow moves to be calculated faster and with sound reasoning, and giving in-depth explanations while also showing other possible valuable moves.",positive
it's a lot of equipment but i guess it helps visualise it better if a robot is moving in real life.,positive
no as it wont ever be able to fully be true,negative
If the technology becomes cheaper and it becomes more popular then yes however a screen is very convenient,neutral
If you already have a robot to do other things then yes but no one is going to buy a robot to just play chess when you can just go online and play for free.,negative
I think chess is a complex game and robots and AI could function well in helping learners especially beginners as it's able to talk through the steps,positive
"Maybe, depending on how far the robot development will go. ",neutral
"Maybe within 10 years. It provides real, tactical game play which many may find beneficial, however I feel at this time it is not nuanced enough. ",neutral
"No, it is too noisy and too cumbersome. It is also far less portable.",negative
No. I think the cost of the robots could be prohibitive. I also dont see robots becoming more popular as they seem unnecessarily bulky,negative
"It's hard to say it would be an improvement, as it is essentially a 3D version of an already existing feature, and having played a chess software in the past, it is hard for the human player to learn from their mistakes. Especially as there is no human element of ""mistake"". However it does seem like a friendlier approach than a 2D computer software, and if given more human elemants, could be an improvement.",neutral
"Probably not - computers can be anywhere, including our homes. Something like this would have to be gone to.",negative
"No, they offer little more than current. ",negative
"Yes, seems to be going in that direction. ",positive
"yes definitely, I cant see why not, if humans give them the knowledge they can be better  .",positive
"Maybe for players who are in a full club or something, but learning from home, no. The ease of a video by a simple search will always be easier than having to buy a robot specifically to learn chess.",negative
"Yes, but I'm not sure it's necessary to remove screen-based computers. The teaching aspect could work the same without a physical robot and chess board. If it did other things as well as chess I could see how that might be better.",neutral
"Yes, because you can physically see what it is doing on a real life chess board, it shows how the game would physically be played ",positive
"yes, since it's just replacing one robot to another robot ",positive
"I could definitely see robots like this serving as replacements to improve chess skills, when I have played against the computer in chess, there is no explanation and movements are done instantaneously. ",positive
it could as technology is fast evolving,positive
"Not really, no, barriers to entry are very high for a robot of this sort, whereas for screen-based computers it's close to non existent as nearly everyone already has one.",negative
"I do not think so. Why i said so is because it might be expensive to maintain or get so, not many people might not be able to afford it. But, we do not know what the future may bring.",negative
"Probably not fully. Screens offer more accessibility and analysis tools, but robots could complement learning by making it more interactive.        ",negative
i would imagine so because the lessons would be given on a real board rather than onscreen,positive
"I think it would be very expensive to implement these robots, even in 10 years when they're inevitably cheaper. It's easier for people to pick up a computer and start learning chess than to find a robot like this to play with them. However, I think it would be able to improve quickly as it performs more matches and gains more varied training data.",negative
"Yes, the use of the robot is more realistic and you can see it live in action. It's more interactive that screen based options.",positive
"depends on what the user wants.  If they want to learn a home, then probably no.  If they want to learn in a different environment, then possibly yes. ",neutral
I think they could just because it's a lot easier for robots like this to generate ideas and explanations than an existing screen based computer can,positive
Maybe because it is more practical to have the robot in front of you for learning.,neutral
"If we have a humanoid robot, probably yes and we can set up a one on one lesson for students as and when needed.",positive
"No, a piece of software running on a screen will be more cost effective and more versatile, ie the same computer that you run your chess program on can also do other things.",negative
"Yes, if the robot is planted well there?s a chance it could serve as a replacement which means it would Make learning the chess easier and faster",positive
yes. we tend to learn better when seeing something real.,positive
Yes. It?s inevitable. And they can show exactly what the move looks like on the board. ,positive
"no, they are expensive and not avaliable to the average person",negative
"yes and no, it may just be significantly costly. Doesn't necessarily improve on what is already out there as far as on screen based computers. ",neutral
They definitely could. I think money will obviously be a huge factor but in community centres / schools I dont see why not.,positive
i don?t think it?s necessary- does the same as stock fish or any other engine just a bit bulkier,negative
Possibly. I imagine this would be an expensive investment to replace current computers.,neutral
"i prefer robots than computers personally, i do not like to stare at screen too long. and actual chess could help me concentrate more ",positive
I think robots would be used to replace existing computers as they are less stressful to handle and work on their own,positive
"possibly? im not sure the investment is immediately worth it, as it doesnt seem to solve much of a problem that video with narration may have. ",neutral
I don't think it can replace humans completely but since it's based on logic and skill they would learn easily. Just without a human touch,neutral
Absolutely not it wouldn?t be fair and it will take the four hour playing chess when it should be a regular board game with regular people,negative
Yes it would be more interesting than using screens,positive
"No. I think more people play chess online (digitally) these days and digital/computer chess would be superior because you have more teaching aids. For instance, you would be able to show potential moves on the board with visual aids instead of just talking about them.",negative
"Yes, it?s much more interactive than screen based learning, especially for those who learn by action.",positive
"Absolutely. If the price is right I think they could do a very good job at replacing computers, to make things feel far more physical",positive
"Yes, i think robots will much more integrated and realistic.",positive
"Assuming you mean that the robot being filmed could replace screen-based computers, yes. If you're talking about actual robots, the resources required to build and ship them would be enormous and not necessarily the best use of finite resources.",neutral
"Potentially, it eliminate sthe boring virtual atmosphere and makes it more interactive.",positive
I guess it can.  Never gave it much thought.,neutral
"Yes I guess so. Although I'm not a fan of robots in a classroom environment,  I think with a game scenario it could work well",positive
"I think so. Robots/AI are the way of the future, so I don't think chess would be excluded from that.",positive
Maybe as it has a lot of knowledge,neutral
"Hard to say. But both are run by software/ai. So is the robot even necessary? A screen based computer will go through the exact moves so I do not think, based on this fact that robots like this will replace computers.",negative
A robot wouldn't be able to think like a human,negative
"It could but I don't see how it would be practical. Computer based chess programs are cheap, can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms, and are already quite advanced from a technical standpoint. The robot by comparison likely will not compete on price and have little to no use outside of teaching chess.",negative
"I don?t see why not, they explain everything and unlike humans you can?t argue with robots.",positive
Absolutely. If someone is more of a hands on learner this approach to teaching would be ideal. ,positive
"Not sure, one thing is playing against a robot, the other is learning. The human element is always helpful for learning. ",neutral
I think robots can help teachers in class as an assistant but the robot cannot replace teachers them selves because it does not look serious.,negative
"No, I would prefer to watch a person teaching how to play, using common regular words, not so robotic speaking.",negative
"it could but having reset or going back a few moves, or showing different outcomes will still be easy on the computer",neutral
Yes and no. Yes - as some students benefit from learning watching a demonstration. No - the screen-based computer could be advantageous if it has interactive features e.g. specific placements on the board. I think it depends on the way in which someone learns.,neutral
"yes because chess is a game of rules and a robot could explain every move a human isnt even necessary due to the limitations of chess theres no freedom of expression, its all moves that every body knows already.",positive
"Takes up too much space, and cannot be used remotely. I dont think it would serve as a replacement but as an alternative. ",negative
They could but the use and production of these robots will be very expensive and too expensive for the average person.,negative
It can replace existing screen based computers because it is AI backed but also it will not be fun because it's too predictive.,positive
Definitely not within 10 years as the cost associated with robots such as these will be much greater than the existing screen-based computers.,negative
"Absolutely. Just as chess itself was easy to digitize for simpler computers and programs, it fits well with new technology (AI) and robotic capabilities.",positive
i dont't think the manipulations on the board are necessary to learn,negative
I am unsure as to whether they could replace computers,neutral
"Why Robots Could Gain Popularity 	1.	Tactile and Physical Engagement ? Many players prefer physical chessboards over digital screens. A robot that moves pieces and provides real-time coaching could offer a more immersive experience. 	2.	Better for Young Learners ? Interactive robots could help children stay engaged and reduce screen time while learning chess. 	3.	AI and Adaptive Learning ? Future robots will likely have stronger AI with personalized coaching, similar to Chess.com or Lichess, but in a real-world setting. 	4.	Classroom and Group Use ? Robots could be useful for schools and chess clubs where multiple students can observe and interact without needing individual devices.  Why Screens Won?t Be Fully Replaced 	1.	Versatility of Screens ? Chess apps allow for online play, advanced analysis, and access to massive databases of games, which a robot may struggle to replicate. 	2.	Cost and Accessibility ? High-quality chess robots with AI coaching would be expensive, whereas chess software on a tablet or PC is widely accessible. 	3.	Portability and Convenience ? A chess app on a phone or laptop is more convenient for learning and playing anywhere, unlike a physical robot. 	",neutral
"i think it?s open to either way, screen based could be more simple and accessible and ?quick? whereas robots would be for more extensive teaching and actually being able to visualise the board physically which can be benefitial.",neutral
I think it might be possible but there are pros and cons. If there is a malfunction or if the input provided is wrong then the output will also be wrong and can misguide people. I think there would need to be continuous observation of the robot and assessment of whether it is functioning properly and providing accurate information.,neutral
Some people do enjoy the company of people while playing a competitive game but the majority of gamers prefer a screen based game so I don't think this robot will fully replace it.,negative
yes. Its being built with required knowledge ,positive
"Absolutely, real world experience is more valuable and the commentary, and ability to ask it questions will aid learning for different students with different levels of need.",positive
yes i think there is a possibility of this happening in the nearest future,positive
I think people will still want to play on personal devices or consoles rather than physically against a robot,negative
"I think for chess it's absolutely possible. For a game that is based on problem solving and quick thinking, a robot can absolutely get the job done. ",positive
"I don't see the cost coming down enough within 10 years for most people and institutions to justify getting a robot like this. Maybe it will exist at some or most universities, but I don't see any grade schools implementing something like this anytime soon. Furthermore, a computer will use the same AI so many people will see no point in getting a robot like this, especially because many AI voice agents are in development.",negative
yes because they will be programme on the commonly FAQs and might be to answer neccesary questions.,positive
"probably yes, as A1 can learn data etc. so it would be able to learn rules of chess.",positive
"Yes, I think robots will improve skills",positive
I think it would be an interesting tool. But it does seem a little elaborate (and expensive) for the ease of a computer making movements. ,neutral
No; I think playing chess against any opponent is the way to improve chess skills. I do not think it matters if an AI opponent has a screen or not.,negative
"Possibly, it depends on the age of the children being taught, ie being distracted by the movements of the robot and not listening",neutral
 thats time its not available  its came right now,negative
"I think they could, but I'm not sure how likely it is in every context. Something like this seems really expensive, which not many public schools could afford. Also, there would need to be more data on how much more helpful it is than existing computers, in order to justify the expense. It's certainly possible, but it doesn't seem likely to me. ",negative
"Yes, I think they are somewhat more interactive than a computer screen.  I think people would resonate more with a robot.",positive
It most likely even if you don?t want due to how fast the technology changing,positive
Hard to say but I doubt it as a screen-based computer has a multitude of functionalities beyond just chess coaching and would perhaps be more useful in a school environment,negative
"I think they could, it seemed to be very helpful. They know the exact moves and what?s happening on the board ",positive
"50/50. I think this could be a very good learning tool provided to novice players and professional, but I think at the end of the day chess comes down to skillset in which a human can provide to eventually win a game of chess however this could be beneficial for providing new techniques/strategies.",neutral
Yes definitely as it?s actually doing the moves in real life,positive
"I think computers may still be more affordable, as many of us already own one, it might be more practical to improve chess skills by simply using a gpt to help practice, or some other AI based software that could help players practice on screen, so this type of robot may not be necessary. ",negative
"Yes, to an extent! It think an interactive approach toward learning is always better than just watching things on screens. However, not all learning material can be taught using robots.    ",positive
"No, I don?t believe the average person will be able to access these types of robots in 10 years. Most people do have computers however.",negative
"I think so, it is more engaging, especially if the user could be the second player and be taught in-person this way.",positive
In my opnion it depends on what they think like people but yes i think they do this,positive
Yes I believe they could replace screen based computers because with improvements this robot could teach more technical skills in the best way possible with real time movements and explanations of those movements.,positive
I think it is a possibility. But I fear for future teachers when I see this.,neutral
"Maybe.  Honestly, it largely depends on the cost.  There are so many, many chess tools available online that are completely free.  If someone had to pay for this robot, why would they when there are so many resources that don't cost anything?  Ultimately it all comes down to how readily accessible these are.  ",neutral
"Yes, I think with the huge advancements in AI it is very possible and the robot in the video is already doing a great job.",positive
"Potentially - The benefits of screens based computers is definitely the accessibility. Having a robotic arm teach chess, while definitely a novel idea, does not provide any additional benefit to actually learning chess over a computer.",negative
"yes, AI getting better and smarter ",positive
At places like schools or chess clubs yes. For learning at home not a chance they would be too expensive to replace a simple computer based ai.,neutral
Yes. I think this robot could teach chess better than screen-based computers if it can be asked questions and give detailed factual answers. And it can show a more hands on approach with students. ,positive
No I don't think it's very feasible. Every classroom would have to have a robot. Where they already have screens which is easier to boot up and watch. ,negative
"Maybe in the narrow sense in which it might improve over-the-board chess, but screen-based computers will likely still be the best way to do things, as they don't have the added latency of physically moving pieces.",neutral
No screen based are far more convenient and take up far less room.,negative
"Yes they could replace screen based computers. It's more engaging playing with the robot on a physical board, rather than screen based ",positive
"definitely, if the robots are skilled up knowing the most common chess algorithms to win it'll be harder for opponents to win",positive
Yes - I see nothing the screen based computers are doing that this is not.,positive
"I think robots will take over just about everything and replace us with robots, which could be good and in other ways bad for us, because we will depend on them to much.",neutral
"I think it could be used as a replacement but I don't think it would completely replace screen-based computers. However, the price might be too high to replace screen-based computers completely. ",neutral
Potentially because it feels more like a real player in front of you and it offers you a chance to practise skills. ,positive
Maybe not a total replacement. But it could be a significant tool. The robot is pretty expensive and takes up a lot of space. Screen-based computers serve many functions. The robot would need to have more uses.,neutral
"Yes. I believe this robot does a much better job of showing the chess strategies in a 3D space, rather than in a 2D board on a computer screen. Seeing the chess strategies in a real environment in my opinion is more effective on teaching children how to recognize chess strategies while also learning new ones. Lastly, the robot is almost like having a real teacher in the room, which I believe is vastly superior for a learning experience instead of having the children listen to computer audio while staring at a computer screen. ",positive
"no, I think screen based chess is faster and more accurate currently and also preferred by players.",negative
Yes I do. The robot provides good explanations for each move and can be used to improve and teach chess skills.,positive
I think it could definitely replace those services as it likely gives similar information but presents it in an easier to understand way as the person learning is able to see the movements in real life. The cost could be a prohibitive factor in replacing pre-existing services as a physical object like this would be far more expensive.,positive
"Potentially they will work for some people but like all learning, people earn in different ways ",neutral
"I?m not sure, I don?t know enough about chess",neutral
"Yes, in theory, although I find it unlikely that the average person would be able to afford one and/or have the requisite space + power + computing requirements to have one in their home. For personal use I would presume screen-based computers would largely remain. Additionally, having a loudly talking robot seems a little unnecessary for teaching chess and may not be desirable in situations where more private/individual study is required (or simply desired). ",neutral
I think in certain places yes. Like research fields and for specific learning but I dont think itll replace the every day computers we use now. ,neutral
"I think they can supplement chess learning, but I don't think they will replace screen based computers as they are not as accessible.",negative
"Yes I can see their use in 10 years to replace screens, maybe sooner it technology allows",positive
"I thinks so. They can learn which part people may have hard time to understand, so they can explain more specifically.",positive
I think so. It is more interactive.,positive
"Yes, because this is much more immersive (three dimensions!) than a computer screen.",positive
Maybe - I think it could help some learners who are more practical and tactile learners.,neutral
"I think this could be an option however, a simple program can probably teach the same things while being far less expensive and more accessible to most.",neutral
"It's fine, but surely a screen-based system would be cheaper and able to be implemented much more widely. It's nice as a demo item, but not practical.",negative
"This is possible as they may give a more 'hands-on' learning experience. But the cost of such a robot would be expensive compared with the costs of running computer based programmes, so I'm not sure many chess teachers would support their widespread use.",neutral
"Yes, I believe with machine learning robots could absolutely serve as a replacement ",positive
"While possible, due to a robot having a physical interaction, thus making it likely more engaging than a screen-based computer, it would still lack the play speed of a screen-based computer as well as wouldn't be able to visually display arrows and variations as effectively, while also probably being a much higher cost to produce and implement than screen-based computers.",negative
I don't think they can serve as a replacement unless big improvements are made.  The robots are not very human like.,negative
"Potentially yes, if they were to explain how and why they?re making the moves they are doing",positive
"Yes, it?s visually appealing ",positive
"Absolutely, sometimes it?s not as easy being on a computer but physically seeing a robot move and why it?s moving there I think is brilliant ",positive
Possibly but I can't see there being too much value added here unless it's more reactive,neutral
"Yes, perhaps so, particularly if the robot is a little livelier. I think the use of something physical can help people to engage all the more. If it's a robot like this that can point out a method via actual movement of the pieces on a 3D board rather than just something someone is interacting with on-screen. That said, I can imagine that the latter would be sufficient for some users. Particularly those who've played a fair bit of chess already and want a speedier way of observing/learning. I imagine with the AI use, one could also ask the robot to show something again/differently/or ask a question about one of the methods discussed.",positive
Nothing at all............,negative
"Yes, it could happen, as it could serve as another player or some type of tutor, someone you can learn from playing, which you can't really replicate or do in the same way on screen-based computers.",positive
"No. Not a replacement. Robots could be another source of learning but they will not replace screeen based systems because they are not easily portable and they are likely to be expensive. A simple screen based system, even an app, is cheap and convenient.",negative
Yes! this is much more visual and realistic!,positive
"Again, I think the expense is far to high for a simple game procedure.",negative
"Yes, If there's an improvement over time. ",positive
"I think it provides a more interactive way of learning, people would be more engaged and more likely to learn with a hands on experience than a screen. Cost might be a factor as it is most likely expensive compared to a tablet or computer. ",positive
"Yes, I do think this will be a replacement in some capacity. I believe this more ""hands-on"" approach serves to help many students learn more effectively. I believe the cost will be a huge barrier to the full replacement of screen-based learning, however. ",positive
"Of course, technology has come to replace computers, cell phones and even people.",positive
"Very much so, that seems like a probable outcome given that AI functions like ChatGPT aids students in learning. Chess is a game of logic so a robot could replace screen-based computers and add value in demonstrating where to move the chess pieces. ",positive
Learning a variety of games is likely to make fewer mistakes than a human playing chess.,neutral
"I don't think a physical robot will be needed, it's much easier and simpler to have AI integrated in some digital format where the user can interact with some interface and have an AI assistant explaining moves like done in the video.",negative
"yes. in ten years to come,robot will be more advanced",positive
"I don't think they will replace them, but I think they could become more popular. It would still take a long time to fine tune all of the uses of the robot and to encourage people to switch to the new technology.",negative
"It depends on how more intelligent they will become, more like a human ",neutral
i think so because the robot is explaing with pratical and with the way AI is going the robot can replace existing based computers,positive
"Robots are able to analyze data better than humans, so it would seem likely they could engage in lessons professionally and properly. ",positive
No. Definitely not. Robots are invading society.,negative
Yes and i say that because it would become something normal,positive
"They could be effective because it was more realistic to have them move the pieces on the board, rather than simply watching a digital board on a screen.",positive
"No, they can seem intimidating to those who do not have regular exposure to them.",negative
Yes I  believe that in ten years time the Robot  could replace exist existing screen based computrr,positive
Definitely possible to replace existing as it give a person a real life chance again someone as practice without the need for humans  ,positive
