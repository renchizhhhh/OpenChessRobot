"R_1rrcFF1idPhXls8","If the view of the robot was the whole board, which could be preprogrammed, then all it needs to do is be able to sense and understand where the pieces are. The robot should not move until it's ready to move its own piece.","1"

"R_4ig3zQOFkrpyJYS","Perhaps if there were some visual laser/light markers to visually depict / mark on the chessboard itself the different areas the robot looks at while it works?

"R_3Ecp7veyfMzC2tb","I see that the robot is moving around doing its thing, but it would be interesting that a beam or a light could point out what it's referring to while giving the explanation.
