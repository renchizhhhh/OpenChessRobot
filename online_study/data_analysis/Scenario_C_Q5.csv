"The technical quality of the robot is impressive. A positive aspect of the robot is that it can provide you with entertainment. A negative aspect of the robot is that it could cheat and be unfair."
"The smoothness of the movement mirrors that of a human, which would be nice to play against. Whereas the person playing against the robot may be discouraged becuase of its ominous physical appearance"
"The technical quality of the robot is astounding as it's able to mimic the dialogue and quote from the movie while performing the move itself. It isn't messing up the move at all and seems to be precise in the actions it does."
"The whirring was a bit loud but otherwise it looked as if it moved smoothly and precisely."
"the robot voice is too monotonish for entertainment purposes"
"I think the AI robot moves swiftly and can make moves on the chess board. "
"the voice of the robot sounds very human like and its intelligence is impressive as it communicates."

"It looks like it is well built. good quality materials and design"
"The movement and motion was very smooth, albeit noisy."
"It was clear and good description of what was asked "
"The technical quality seemed pretty high. The robot clearly has fine motor movements enough to carefully grasp pieces and move them without knocking over others. It also combines this feature with a camera to plan its movements and audio."
"The robot is a bit clunky and too big for a domestic environment."
"It moves pretty quickly and speaks less robotic than I would have expected. It seems to have a good understanding and capability to play chess."
"Seems fine. It's a chess robot, so a robotic arm with a bunch of servos seems appropriate"
"The robot gives an in depth analysis on the position and where it is from. "
"The quality looks very good, it is just a bit weird to see something like this for the first time"

"it moves efficiently and is able to read and react to the opponents moves"
"I like the fact that it was able to differentiate the queen from the pawn"
"The technical quality of the robot is positive because it operates in an efficient way."
"It moves very smoothly but is quite chunky in its shape "
"The robot looks and sounds very technologically advanced, something that could be out of a movie!"
"it is smart as trying safer options instead of taking off some piece"
"i dont have much to compare it to"
"Seems precise, bit dull and slow. Would be more interesting if it moved faster!"
"It was very robotic in movement. Nothing exceptional. "
"The robot seems to know basic skills and it is not too large. It seems to compute how to play a game and make decisions. "
"I think it’s really cool. I don’t play chess but I can see how someone who lives alone or wants to practice would love this"
"It speaks like a human being"
"I think it was cool how the robot described what happened and what could have been done instead this could likely be applied to many other situations from movies. I also liked the voice it was very relaxing."
"I could help you to learn how to play chess"
"The robot looks like it has limited capacity. It's only an arm that grab things. It can't move any further on it's own and would need somebody to move it. It also can't do anything physically other than moves things. It's intellectual capacity is unknown."
"The robot looks like it has high technical quality. I like the fact that it giving references and facts while showing the board and moving the peices."
"The robot (or the video) appears to be quirky."
"Positive aspects: It can pick up the chess pieces and explains the game. "
"No technical problems. "
"Timely and accurate responses to prompts"
"Precise movements during the chess game"
"The chess bot might be a fantastic addition in a chess teaching academy or championship. The audio and the working arm seems to be working in sync. "
"It looks technologically advanced. "
"It's so boring, slow and forced. Noisy, too."
"I think it looks really amazing, I would love to have something like this for entertainment purposes. It looks awesome."
"The robot seems to know what it's doing"
"The robot doesn't seem very human, it looks just like a robotic arm that moves. It could be on an assembly line in a factory. It seems accurate in its grip when picking up items and can move smoothly, so it can play chess and do other fine motor tasks."
"Seems slow to pick up the pieces. Like the voice"
"the positives are the apparent  intellect and the manoeuvrability of the robot "
"The robot look solid and well built, it's operational movements appear fluid, wide ranging and relatively quiet. It possesses a sleek design that is appealing to the eye"
"The fork of the robot in the video is probably too large and bulky to be really plausible for home use. I would imagine price point would be far too expensive for most households also"
"The robotic arm functions smoothly and is gentle enough to grab and move the chess pieces like a real person would."
"the robot moved smoothly around the board, moving pieces easily, It is a bit on the large size though"
"It is very realistic."
"It might tend to make mistakes "
"The robots asks for feedback on what to do next and does it to precision. "
"It sounds extremely well-informed and clear, while the movements are smooth as well. Whether that is still the case when measurements are slightly off, though, is another matter."
"It seems pretty smooth movement-wise and sound-wise. Did not immediately see anything negative"
"Very good fine movement. Did not knock over pieces with movements next to other pieces. Moved quickly. "
"positive.Movement & Fluidity: Does it move smoothly, or is it jerky? Accuracy & Precision: Does it complete tasks correctly? Stability & Balance: Does it remain stable, or does it seem shaky? Responsiveness: How well does it react to changes? Build Quality: Are there visible flaws in construction? Innovation: Does it use any advanced or unique technologies? "
"I think it is quite interactive how it explains things and demos them to you and asks what you would like to try. The audio is clear as well and easy to understand. Only negative would possibly be the noise it makes when moving"
"Robot seems to have rather smooth movements and was gentle with chess. The voice of the robot was pleasant and it was engaging to listen. However, one can still tell it is a robot by the way pauses are done in the speech."
"Its movements seem very precise and accurate. It has a sleek looking appearance as well. "
"I wasn’t sure the voice was matched with the arm at first. Also seems like a basic robotic arm. Interesting how it wasn’t just making the next move it was a more nuanced discussion of chess from a film and moves the robot could take."
"I think its super cool i like how mobile it is, It is a bit bulky tho"
"It was pretty good; the video didnt show complete range of motion so hard to say with certainty the variations available. "
"Clear communication, smooth movement"
"It looks better than most human players since it has algorithms to run through "
"overall i think it looks good, movements are very jerky and I would like to see it be more fluid"
"The motion was smooth and precise."
"The focus on one thing at a time. The requests made."
"Technically it is accurate and doesn't make mistakes"
"There is too much bulk to the claw of the robot. If someone were sitting opposit it on the board, it would block the view of the pieces and could be quite intimidating coming towards a sitting person."
"they can be used as a substitute for a real player"
"it can be more strategic than han the human brain"
"A really good quality"
"The robot is obviously programmed well, it is visible from the precise movements that accompany the explanation. It is obviously not very human however, that can either be a negative or a positive depending on who the robot is for or the intentions of its design."
"The robot is very realistic, especially with the human voice. It sounds like it could be an actual person talking, rather than the typical robotic voice. The only possible negative is the loud sound the robot makes when moving, but this is to be expected."
"The voice is very clear and audible and the movement is very smooth and precise. The only negative aspect is that it looks like a robot and isn't visually appealing."
"It's noisy and seems cumbersome. "
"I will say AI is getting very advanced and smarter "
"The robot has smooth movement, but the noise of its movement is a little off putting. Looks nicely designed, modern and not overly robotic."
"the robot seems to be quite a primitive design . the positive is the speech is very realistic however which does help the overall feel of the robot"
"I think the movement of the robot is really smooth and fluent. The movement works well "
"It is technically capable although rather large. It talks clearly and is knowledgeable. "
"It seems to know what’s it’s doing. It’s just too robotic. "
"It is a little noisy. "
"Looks cutting edge and incredibly advanced."
"It seems to be a sturdy robot, pretty high quality."
"positive: The robot talks/speaks to you and plays chess with you."
"I mean it's cool to play chess with a robot why would you want that."
"I think it seems pretty capable of what it seems to be made to do. The movements are good but the noise of said movement might get old fast."
"looks smooth responsive etc"
"Having a real world analog to help simulated actual play of a chess match is helpful. This could be beneficial for those who have trouble visualizing different game states in their mind. Outside of that, there doesn't seem to be much advantage of using a physical robot for this demonstration. The same information and simulation could be presented in a completely digital format."
"positive feedback, cause  it can teach human or child to think before move "
"Its movements are smooth which are good, but almost seem delayed."
"Technically it looks sturdy, and that the robot knows what is doing, and actions are performed precisely"
"The robot seems to move very smoothly and efficiently and the design is cool and modern looking, however the movements seem to create a fairly loud noise that could be grating."
"I'm not too knowledgeable about technology, I guess it was clear and concise with what it was saying and able to process what was happening on the chessboard"
"It makes robot noises and moves convincingly, but it could be just another mechanical Turk.  Nothing to indicate whether it is moving of its own volition or being operated by somebody not in view."
"Technically it appeared to perform very well. It made the moves with precision. It explained the moves with clarity too. "
"It appears to be very smooth moving and responding to its own statements. However I don’t get the sense that the robot is actually talking to me, it seems more like a prerecorded message that aligns with its movements. For me it seems there is a disconnect."
"The robot seems to be high quality and the movement is smooth. However, it seems more appropriate in a medical or industrial setting rather than in a home or interacting with laypeople. I could see it working in a clean room on semiconductors, or assisting with a medical procedure, but not as an entertainment device or companion.  It's too bulky and limited in its movement. Also it's a little intimidating in its size and strength and operating pose."
"The robot itself seems sturdy and reliable. The voice is suitable and not too unnatural. Its movements are a bit slow and it gave me the impression that the arm was moving back and forth more than it needs to be."
"it's a computer. it's good at following commands/algorithms set out by whatever AI is in charge. It still doesn't compare to the social aspect of competing with an actual human person."
"If it said how many moves you have, such move one move two move three"
"The technical quality of the robot is high.   The most negative aspect is that the voice itself attached is quite monotonous. "
"Although it is certainly clever - I hate these type of things. Robots are taking over the world so I will leave it to the young generations to get involved with them."
"it will help one with posible ways to attack and defend, thereby boosting one strategy in playing"
"Describes and explains well, as well as prompting user."
"The robot looks too industrial. I guess it will be interesting at start but become boring after a few games."
"I think the robot is very technically impressive, especially since you can communicate with it directly and have the potential to ask it chess questions to improve your understanding of the game or the benefits of certain positions. One negative aspect of the robot is the noise it produces when moving, and the robot seems quite heavy and possibly a little bit difficult to set up. It seems it needs to be clamped onto a table, so I'm wonder how strong the table would need to be and if any warping would be shown."
"The accuracy of the movements seem quite good and the speech is quite clear. If it was built on a smaller scale it wouldn't be as imposing over the chess board."
"The robot shows good technical skills by demonstrating the options of where to place the chess pieces, and the specific tile location. "
"It seems to have the dexterity to move the chess pieces"
"Negative is that it is slow positive is that it explains in detail"
"The movement makes a noise which i do not like, also it is not smooth in motion. I like the voice of the robot, it is calm but sounds intelligent"
"The robot looks very technically competent"
"I would say the robot is of a lower to medium quality. It looks like a diy style product that was home assembled. The movements are relatively slow with noisy motor. The positional accuracy does appear reasonably good."
"the robots movements are very fluid and the speech programmed for it are very articulate. it is quite imposing however and maybe not suitable to be used around children "
"The robot looked like it moved quite smoothly. It also moved at the correct time that the words were saying to move. Although, the sound didn't feel like it was coming from the Robot but like someone was telling it what to do. "
"The positive is you have someone to play with if you live alone. The negative is, it’s too noisy when moving plus it’s slow."
"Very monotone and not very expressive"
"The robot looks quite large and clunky and is also very noisy ."
"seemed to be aware of what was going on and the moves to use"
"i like that it moves the pieces but it would be very big to have in the house and store."
"it’s impressive, It truly shows remarkable technological improvement. It looks a bit clunky compared to futuristic ideas of robotics, but is still impressive "
"I think the robot it very big and takes up a lot of space making it a little bit out of touch. I would also say that it is helpful, but at what cost? "
"The robot seems efficient and quite accurate "
"It’s an interesting technology, definitely something people would enjoy. The fact that it talks to you and can play chess is something very fascinating. Younger generations would love this but unfortunately old generations would probably dislike."
"The robot clearly demonstrates other possible moves. It is interactive as it asks which of the possible moves the participant/opponent would like to try. I found the noise the robot made when moving a little distracting."
"It appears to be a  talking chess robot with  precise and fluid piece movement. The positives are  smooth mechanics, strategic explanations, and real-time feedback that enhances learning."
"The quality of the robot seems really good. The robot has precise movements when moving the chess pieces and the sound quality of the voice is good too."
"The voice is not realistic, but it's fairly close. It seems to perform well, to understand a complex scenario and to try to entertain a viewer."
"The robot looks a bit primitive"
"It moves so smoothly  It’s a bit bulky in size"
"the robot seems to move flawlessly, not knocking any chess piece and being pretty precise on where to move each chess piece. it is very impressive. "
"Don't know much about robots but it looks very receptive and capable and l believe it can perform all the functions they are intended for. It can also perform some complex problem solving and cognitive activities."
"I think this is pronoun. I would love to play against this horrible."
"the robot has technical quality because it is able to move pieces"
"It's very fluid and the movement is excellent"
"The technical quality looked slightly dated"
"the robot has precised mechanical movements , ensuring accurate placement of pieces"
"I don't play chess but it seemed that you would be able to have an entertaining game with the robot, it seemed to be fully understanding of the game. The only negative is that it is very robotic, no human traits at all.  "
"It looks very functional. I don't think it would fit in with most people's home aesthetics"
"The robot looks very smooth and precise, it has a realistic voice making it more engaging "
"The robot seems to be 'thinking' about it's next move at the start of the video. The movements of the robot seem to be quite smooth and 'flows'."
"It has an old style of robot which is appealing not trying to be human"
"The height and weight of the robot should be considered I do like the idea behind this. I'd support it."
"I think it might help children or adults learn how to play chess."
"While it seems to work fine with that exact setup, I feel like it wouldn't be practical to use a more traditional tournament chess setup with bigger pieces. Needing to be clamped down this way also makes it much more restricted on locations."
"Smooth movement, quick to move"
"Robots are becoming o much more advanced, so a robot to provide entertainment is highly viable. This robot moves well and clearly understands what moves to make and when. "
