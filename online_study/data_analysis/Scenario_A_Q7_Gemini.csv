67acbb11d4d3ce0c5d61eef7,"I think for some people who are auditory leaners, this could be a great alternative to text based learning. That being said, as people learn in many different ways, I don't personally see robots such as this completely replacing screen based models.",negative
5d46daa91274770001916403,"They could because they are so advanced already.",positive
666d9692dac9d55d3f331401,"No, because while the technology is still developing fast, people get sceptical and end of the day, humans develope robots. ",negative

6760765e6a687b2878284f5e,"Partly but I don't think they could completely replace screen based computers. They could be an excellent replacement in technical areas. Especially demonstrating physical actions.",neutral
614e32cf6eacf837eb9d5c48,"The words spoken by the robot were concise and  understandable. But words alone would not be an ideal teaching tool - they should be accompanied by some sort of visual aid.",neutral

57b27d847d42b700012dd055,"yes because a lot of advancement is coming in the next 10 years.",positive
6448501a005e0fe9d154fa89,"I'm not entirely sure. I think it would certainly help explain things because of the fact that it can express, through movements, what it's trying to explain. Like how humans use our arms etc to emphasise points. However having a screen can mean showing so much more to help visualise aspects of conversations and topics.",neutral
63d7b18eebaaaac354afdde0,"I think it would take longer to adopt such technology in the workplace ",neutral
655b66a54fed8fea8a342e40,"Sure they can. They are evolving fast and will a more common form of interaction.",positive
676596632513c937ab526caa,"I do partly believe so as some people are visual learners, and so seeing it happen in front of their eyes and described step by step may help students to learn more effectively.",neutral

62853f0fcc7f1334c7f965f0,"Yes. By interacting with physical objects the robots represent human dynamics more easily and its operations can be more clearly understood.",positive
5e416065194a5639ef32326b,"They should be able to replace screen-based systems though it is unclear about the cost involved. An 8000-dollar robot doesn't seem as useful as a 30-dollar program",neutral
66427f0b55de60f109f6fdab,"No because that is very complicated",negative
65a606f7822585aa77d7b2f1,"I hope not - I think it gets rid of the written words for people to read to understand topics, could be used for kinestic and auditory learners",negative
66a3ac0c7093275627cde87c,"Not really, this is more expensive than computers, has little value to general personal users ",negative
65084a5ee9f095c9602252cb,"NO. I believe that being totally autonomous is against human nature, and humans want to preform tasks themselves to ensure there are no mistakes",negative

5df7f73b6d8cc7000a390c2e,"I think they can, but not in the time-frame. I think we're 20-30 years away from that",negative
678cccf35dc35d491d79287b,"That thought really scares me. Yes, I do think they will have the capability to replace computers- but at what cost? Are robots going to phase human reliance out of existence? I don't really know a whole heck of a lot about computer vision but I know that the technological advances in robotics is astounding.",neutral
671fb7534780312b6355a4c1,"Yes. 10 years is a long time in tech to get all the gimmicks in the right places to make robots feel more real and personal to everyone.",positive

6764aac86a6be53265dfaed0,"I do not think they could serve as a total replacement. Being able to showcase technologies like computer vision using a robot arm is more of an additional piece of equipment to help make people understand certain technologies in a more physical capacity.",negative
6653501881b7b5eff113a16d,"I think certain fields that require physical effort would be good areas to replace screen-based computers, however things that can be demonstrating purely through vision wouldn't be applications for robots like this",neutral
67acc7032e625a43376e7f61,"Yes, but I think it still needs human touch as it would be boring with only a robot",neutral
676ab6e8d3d98bb7f5865d13,"I don't think they could replace computers within 10 years. I think simple human input by touch/typing will still be relevant, and perhaps preferred by most people.",negative
67acd0613d7ac65fd6711f58,"While robots like this could make learning more interactive, they are unlikely to fully replace screen-based computers in the next 10 years. Computers still offer greater flexibility for complex tasks, but robots can complement education by providing hands-on experience and real-world applications.",negative
67acd11081be84b57f014775,"These robotic systems will improve hands-on education but cannot accomplish the complete replacement of screen-based computing technology during the coming decade. The use of computers represents an improved method of teaching advanced computational topics since they deliver flexible teaching approaches at reduced costs with scalable implementation for students.

640e2036e0ad54ebd72a767d,"I think it needs to be more fun if you are going to use it to teach kids.  Yes, the robot is cool, but he talks way above their level.",neutral
655a97bf4d75ee9bf7ab0794,"Yes, if done correctly this is possible. Actually seeing something in real life making real-life movements makes teaching easier. ",positive
676acfc70772c5c50145296a,"I'm not sure a robot like this one would replace screen-based computers. Computers seem much more versatile, capable of a wide range of activities related to a wide range of topics - they are more flexible to the changing needs of education, whereas this robot or similar ones seem more limited in their scope.",negative
669bdf1366bec6caf675341e,"Yes because it is interactive and you could ask it questions and it would answer.",positive
67084ae86c7329d1a13b625e,"I would not think so.  This robot is just a task oriented robot and could not replace screens.  To illustrate a few tasks that robot could do and why they are doing them is good for this type of robot, but i don't think it is capable of replacing screen based computers",negative
66c8b25c066e45c9b0e81d57,"In my opinion, it really depends on the costs. If the cost is low then I don't see why this cannot be an alternative. It also depends on how effective it is for students to learn this way. ",neutral
58fb83d9f3c0f100015d5c45,"Probably not because the screen based computers still will be cheaper version and probably 3d hologram will be more useful than robots for educational purposes ",negative

606cd35c0bb26a795b9cb148,"I don't think so. It would be too costly, and I don't think there will be enough improvement in the next 10 years where that will be necessary.",negative
676abe0387f2f0992312a5d5,"It could be a possibility, but some learners might find it more difficult to follow as they might be visual learner and need text to follow. It could work well for a kinaesthetic learner. ",neutral
6713bb6248cc2fd211952d7a,"Yes because visual learning is easier to take in and remember ",positive
66c8f1c6144b931694a3c736,"Depends on the cost mainly. Screen based computers are probably more diverse",neutral
58d7ab1b31506e0001447859,"Yes, with further development I believe that this is very likely to be the case as robots will be able to explain well and clearly, including tailoring their language and complexity to people of differing abilities. ",positive
66a773d4190ba4a8ec71d766,"Probably not. Seems slightly impractical, I still think a screen will be the dominant form.",negative

63a7a09cc50b61e23ab424ae,"For some people, especially those who are vision impaired, I can see that being very useful. But in general, I can't imagine people preferring a 3D object like a robot to screens. Part of that is because we haven't replaced books with something 3D.",negative
677580fb6d51edae18443c50,"Yes. They can offer hands on learning and teaching of technical concepts. ",positive
5bf461a20d079d00012a85a7,"I think probably not, but they could help enhance learning or more probably help with engagement of certain topics. The reason for not is due to the robot being able to demonstrate one or two specific parts of a topic where a screen can essentially show you anything.",negative
65ebb614d2f7accb27486117,"I guess so. The explanation was a little technical and it didn't really use any visual aids in exaining how it works. I think a screen based explanation could use more visuals in the explanation to make it clearer.",neutral
60ebaa55340060ab518419d0,"maybe i am not sure if it is practical",neutral
6765dd5fcf9a3ac2bbac6825,"This could help in a future. The question would be how much interaction you could have with the robot to ask question and explain wording and actions. If it is possibly then this could easier flowing passage of information. Intelligence and response of the robot would be crucial. As well as adapting the style when needed.",neutral
60feb622ae107ad3083ebde6,"Potentially, depending on the advancement of robots.  I think robots can be used to teach some technical topics, but not others.  Something like playing chess makes sense, but other more serious topics may not be appropriate.",neutral
65df89297f6db227b461a490,"Yes they could - BUT might be that screen or VR based alternatives will be more appropriate and lower cost?",neutral
60cd83946509ada9844efee9,"I think so. While this robot's explanation could be more comprehensive, it does a good job at clearly expressing what it does.",neutral

652d3d3c8e375878e83f43f3,"Yes, and there could also be humanoid robots that mimic teachers which would make it seem more natural",positive
66c62c2a76d4919685cd6767,"Yes as technology has been advancing very quickly",positive
67607e34fb2abbf20ec24851,"yes i think so because AI will become more intelligent. it already is very intelligent but will become more advanced and provide more services in line with what humans do now",positive
663b77db2898db3b8c1bceac,"Yes it could because this helps with the learning since in person and not on a screen",positive
6604ab13b9e324e7e8e6b78a,"I am not 100% sure, but I think they could replace screen based computers or at the very least augment them. The reason being that they would be able to physically show what the robot is doing and at the same time as it is doing it. I thing using robots also can have the appearance of being more interactive as it exists in the physical world, also robots are just cool.  ",neutral
614e34945dfd7dfcc9012760,"Yes, it is possible for robots to do such - if people can adapt and get used to such a shift. Not all humans may embrace such a change, even if technologically it is feasible and well more efficient.",neutral

67693b69371357770f713607,"I think in regards to replacing computer vision I feel that it most likely will not be replaced as far as I am aware that it would be highly costly and it would require much more advanced infrastructure. Thus the benefits would out weight the costs and it was not be effective.",negative

In my experience having a real, hands-on example of something to study is infinitely better than having a computer simulated version of it (I assume that is what ""screen-based computers refers to).  It is way more fun/exciting to be able to peek and poke at something in real life.  Having said that, In 10 year I suspect (fear?) that AI will be creating the bulk of the software in the world, including the software use in robots.

I'm sure those will exist--the kind of do already, with Siri or Alexa, but in my experience those types of programs are less helpful than manually looking on a topic on your own and reading about it (or watching a video) to learn about something at your own pace, in a way that works best for you. It's much easier to go back if you clicked the wrong link than to wait for the robot to finish its explanation if it's talking about the wrong topic; a screen also shows you multiple options at a time, but a screenless robot can only talk about one thing from one source.",negative
