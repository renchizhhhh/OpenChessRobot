"Q6_Response"
"Perhaps a way to muffle the sound of the mechanics of the robot could be useful to keep focus on the actions rather than the sound. "
"I would like to see the code on screen as the robot explains how. "
"Maybe use different voices for different scenarios so people can relate more to the robot."
"No, I do not have any recommendations. "
"I do not have any recommendations for this model."
"Maybe explain things in more laymen's terms. This may be difficult to understand to some younger people, or older people for that matter."
"The robot could be more personable than instructional at times when appropriate "
"My only recommendation would be to make the robot appear more friendly to children."
"The robot should be trained on how to win games based on the positions on the board. "
"I really don't know enough about modern robot tech to have any input on improving this device. I'd be engaged in, eh, puffery, if I commented."
"maybe have a more soothing voice and have the option to go in more depth explanation."
"Add more intonation to sound more human"
"No, it speaks clearly."
"Make it faster in order to keep students attention"
"It could explain what the Aruco markers are. It could be improved by having different settings for appropriate vocabulary for different age groups. For example, grade school kids would need simpler words than college students. "
"no one cares how it works, it should just get straight into how to open"
"free standing rather than clamped to edge of the table"
"Noise should be decreased"
"give it some eyes to make it look human"
"talk about strategies simpifly language"
"It needs to have a more human friendly fascia rather than just the mechanical arm"
"improve outward design to make it more appealing. humanise the voice"
"The robot could use more simple language, especially if talking to children "
"No, it seems suited for the job it's being asked to do."
"No i don't really know any recommendations at this time"
"The low pitch of voice can often be drained sounding and lack the effect of keeping your attention instead sounding boring and repetitive "
"Change the voice and dull down the language being used a little."
"i do not currently have any"
"Different color than iPhone white"
"Maybe the voice could be a bit more futuristic? "
"Perhaps pauses for thought "
"It seems a bit too bulky, but that's just a visual thing."
"i thought it was ok, maybe if it talked more human like and less robotic"
"Maybe less techinical jargon - explain things as if explaining to a younger person (8 year old)."
"visual screen to show thought / logic processes"
"I do not have any recommendation"
"It could move a little faster "
"it would look better if it was smaller and less intimidating"
"Have the robot be able to respond to simple commands or questions (if its not already able to)."
"Quieter motors for the movement "
"I think maybe for teaching purposes, the robot should less technical language and more so language that will resonate with the people who will learn from it."
"Using simplistic analogies after discussing what process the robot is using could help kids to better understand what exactly is happening. "
"No recommendations I have nothing to add to how to improve."
"perhaps make the operations more seamless and less monotonous "
"Maybe use a different voice to sound more human."
"Maybe make it look more friendly if you are going to use it with children"
"Maybe imrpove the shape and look of it"
"I would suggest the mechanism being quieter."
"If it is to teach school children, it will have to explain or define the terminology it uses, such as ""occupancy"" "
"Probably just change the language it uses to something more user friendly (speech to be more laymans)"
"More simplified vocabulary "
"yes make it more personal, about the way it analyses the strategy of chess"
"The voice could be less robotic"
"I would make it explain what it’s doing in a more simplistic way to help everyone understand easier "
"The robot glossed over the procedure a little too quickly. A little bit more detail would have been since especially for younger kids if it's going to be used in schools"
"Some people might prefer a robot that has visual characteristics of a human."
"Yes, simplify the language, and it was very boring to listen to and watch"
"It would be nice to hear it with a female voice, or a gender neutral voice."
"No, I think the robot works well"
"maybe change the look so it doesn't resemble a microscope.  "
"Yes I would say a more human voice to sound more realistic. Also less background noise from robot."
"Not being reliant on markers"
"If it is for children in schools, some of the words used are too complex and difficult."
"More realistic movements"
"Perhaps making it look and sound more human could make it a little less intimidating"
"I would maybe add a screen to it and show some visual things alongside the audio."
"speak in simpler language"
"Give the robot a less clinical look"
"use simple English so users can understand"
"I think the design is very well made. The only thing I would change is cosmetic! "
"Make the robot less 'robot-like' and attach an LED screen with a fun looking character or face. "
"It would be nice to add some simplified version of robots actions explanations for younger children at schools."
"Perhaps a deeper explanation on what it is doing."
"add a human element to it so its ai and real person"
"Break down the technical terms into easier to understand steps."
"A softer voice would make it less intimidating "
"The design could potentially look sleeker in future models and it could maybe have varying degrees of detail in its explanations to appeal to different demographics."
"Maybe talk less robotic and more personable."
"Need more programmig feature to explain the task in different ways in case someone did not understand. "
"I think a human like robot will be more interesting and exiting for kids"
"Depending on the age of the audience it might be beneficial to make the robot more sympathetic looking. If being used for younger audience this may help engage them and make it easier for them interact with the robot."
"Eliminate the echo in the voice."
"More inflection in the voice."
"give it a face made of lights to make it have more personality"
"Perhaps a smoother voice that sounds less roboty. Only because it would make it seem even more impressive as well as make it easier for understanding what it's trying to explain. "
"Less visible wires might make it look better "
"The arm could have a more human like shape."
"Talk through more how the robot will perform a certain task. "
"I would change the color, it looks like a dental instrument"
"The video is a bit short so more information would be really valuable so the viewer understands what is being displayed, yes the robot understands the board but how is this put into motion? Does it play, or does it simply recognise the location of each pawn?"
"Robot’s movements are squeaky - a bit distracting "
"No recommendations at this moment. "
"The robot seems excellent. it has a fully mechanical arm that allows it to accurately interact with the pieces on the board. I see no need to improvement as it just mimics the arm of a human playing in the same way."
"I would have it show several correct moves to show the actual ability."
"No I don’t have any recommendations "
"no - other than please do not make it human looking I find those way to creepy"
"Add algorithms to find the best move "
"Already place such data into the system"
"Maybe offer an option of familiar sounding voices with positive associations to further engage students e.g. Neil deGrasse Tyson"
"I think just the sound of the movement which is a little bit distracting and takes away from the robot talking. "
"Have the robot explain how it plays I.E how many possible moves it's thought of ahead of time etc. Saying figures like this would really flex how much data process is going on! "
"No recommendations except maybe making it a pretty color."
"The voice could be made to sound more natural and ""conversation-like"" to draw in more interest."
"Less technical jargon "
"Less noisy - every move had a noise associated with it.  Can the robot be made smaller, more sleek."
"It would be ok for supplementary teaching after alrdy understand what the terms mean"
"more inflectiion in the voice"
"Different voice options"
"looks good for playing chess"
"The only thing is the voice, is still very robotic, it could have a more friendly voice."
"The only thing I would improve based on what I can see in the short video is the sound it makes. I would imagine hearing the mechanical noises it makes over and over again may become annoying."
"Maybe making the robot as a humanoid would appeal more towards the students at school."
"I think the robot could be more humanized"
"Perhaps the language used by the robot could be simplified for use in schools. It could also do with being quieter when it moves."
"Although the robot already has voice assistance, improving its speed of piece recognition and movement would make interactions smoother. Additionally, enhancing its ability to explain strategies in more detail could further improve its educational value."
"The robot could be improved by increasing its movement speed, enhancing its vision system for better piece recognition, and refining its grip for smoother handling of chess pieces."
"I think the robot needs to explain what the grid is and how he is calculating the position of each piece. "
"Not really. It appears to do what it was made to do. Design-wise it looks fine. "
"If the aim is to have it speak to school children, some of its language may need to be simplified. Potentially incorporating some sort of digital ""face"" onto it may make it more appealing to children, particularly the young."
"Make it look more like a cute robot that a child would want to talk to."
"I think this is what a perception of the robot is, this is a low-task robot so I don't think aesthetics will matter in perception of a capable robot"
"When the robot is moving the sound is a bit too loud in my opinion so it can be quieter. Also, I would prefer if the robot makes its actions faster as it takes too long to calculate. "
"I can't give any recommendations because I don't have enough knowledge about robots "
"If it's for younger kids maybe a digital face or something so it looks less snake like."
"If the view of the robot was the whole board, which could be preprogrammed, then all it needs to do is be able to sense and understand where the pieces are. The robot should not move until it's ready to move its own piece."
"The language that the robot speaks should be more straightforward to laypeople."
"I think the voice needs improved "
"If to be used in a primary and it could look more child friendly"
"No.  Aside from that I think the voice is a bit stilted, but clearly that would be resolved during development. "
"No, it seems as though it is operating as it should."
"A different and friendlier voice would be better. "
"Include human interaction allowing slow response for the robot too"
"The robot is explaining that it detects occupancy and things like that, but I don't know how the robot is measuring those things. I'm sure it's very complicated, but it'd be neat to know what criteria it uses to determine whether a space on the board is occupied or not."
"Improve it to detect the chess board without needing the markers. "
"Apart from the robot actually demonstrating moving the pieces I don't have any recommendations on improving the robot."
"The exanation could simiplified a little better."
"I find it a bit cumbersome"
"The simplification of the language possibly."
"Potentially putting some kind of camera that can detect the type of chess piece quicker"
"Maybe options for less technical language. How about allowing keyed or spoken questions from the audience?"
"Its movements could be quieter and less ""jerky""."
"I'd try to make it quieter"
"I think it's really good as is"
"Try to add more emotion/ a different pace when talking"
"the voice can be a bit more human and personable"
"If it is going to be used in schools then simpler terminologies should be used to allow them understand the game better"
"No I thinks the style of robot is well suited to this application. You could put a face on it but that would just be creepy. not all robots have to look human. In fact I would say that no robots should look human."
"Perhaps if there were some visual laser/light markers to visually depict / mark on the chessboard itself the different areas the robot looks at while it works?  Although personally I can figure it out myself, some people kind of need those 'visual' cues ( aka like some scanning beam they can see )."
"my recommendations about how to improve the robot is have more of human voice and clear voice in place like school "
"only recommendation is the appearance."
"Introduction of additional AIs could be more beneficial."
"Making it smaller or lighter would make it more usable. But it can also help to make it look like a real human."
"There should be more showing than telling for instructional robots"
"The robot kind of looks like a hand mixer. I think if it had a better shape, it would make it more appealing. "
"Make it smaller so that it doesnt take up as much space"
"No recommendations to offer. "
"I believe it would be better to verbalize the coordinates (A1, B2, C3, etc...) when describing it's ""thought"" process. "
"None. It's really cool and I wish I could see the whole demo. Maybe go into some more detail as to what an ArUco marker is, or how occupancy and piece classification works."
"I would add a spotlight beam so it is obvious which part of the board the robot is looking at."
"Make it appear more human if used in schools"
"The robot should communicate in more straightforward language. Perhaps a nickname for the robot would be good too."
"The voice should sound more human rather than a robot. It should also be well paced."
"sometimes people like robots to be humanised ie with eyes"
"no, it seemed helpful and comprehensive. i can't think of any faults or need for improvement "
"I do not have enough evidence to believe this would be good for scholars "
"A hyperactive kid might zone out when it hears ""ArUco"" or  ""occupancy and piece classification,"" so for students, the robot has to have more of a teacher and conversational voice. Also the voice was picked to sound ""sci-fi"" when it should be picked to sound like a human"
"Faster processing to ensure smoother and more responsive game-play. Improved speech synthesis to make its explanations sound more natural and engaging."
"voiced feedback to explain moves, strategies, or errors"
"Does the robot have any logic to detect if the opponent has made any illegal moves (that is, they are cheating)."
"It should use plain language to explain what it is doing."
"IF IT CAN BE MINIATURIZE TO OCCUPY LESS SPACE THAT WOULG BE GOOD"
"None come to mind based on a 28 second video. There is likely more the robot can do that I just haven't seen yet."
"I see that the robot is moving around doing its thing, but it would be interesting that a beam or a light could point out what it's referring to while giving the explanation. For example, I didn't know what an ArUco marker was until I saw and deduced while watching the video."
"No, I don't know enough about robots to recommend an improvement."
"it could definitely be less loud. it also did not talk in terms most people would understand  "
"I do not. The survey is requiring me to write at least twenty characters before I submit, though, so I'll say that it doesn't look very portable. I realize the arm is huge and heavy, but a chess-playing robot that can be moved around easily (and put away easily) would be better than one that's stuck on a big table."
"To ensure responsible robot usage, focus on human-robot collaboration, prioritize ethical guidelines and accountability, rigorously test and establish safety protocols, invest in relevant education and training, and encourage ongoing research and innovation."
"No it’s already perfect "
"right now, i have no recommendation. "
"I would just try to simplify the descriptions of robot uses"
"nothing seems pretty smart "
"can't think of anything"
"So far nothing! Maybe explain with not so technical terms or use simple words when the robot engages whenever it is used for the youth. But for specifications of this study in particular, no nothing to recommend right now!"
"No, I don't have any recommendations."
"This is a personal preference, but I find that natural human voices are easier for me to pay attention to and follow."
"Make the language less technical, it’s difficult to understand. The robot has a very basic appearance and doesn’t see able to perform any other functions."
"I would try to explain the process in much simpler words that children would find easier to understand."
"Possibly make the robot move in a way whilst talking that goes closer to the chess board so it is even more understandable what the robot is showing whilst it is explaining."
"Probably add a few steps in regards to what it can do with this information and how it processes it all. "
"Maybe be more on level with the age it is talking too. Not so professsional posh sounding. "
"perhaps have the speech a bit slower"
"I don't know enough about robotics to make any recommendations."
"It could look more human"
"The voice can be better, more human"
"Normal voice would suffice"
