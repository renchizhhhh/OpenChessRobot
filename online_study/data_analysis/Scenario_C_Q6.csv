"Q6_Response"
"perhaps the sound would become a bit annoying. Might change the sound of the movement."
"The only recommendation I would suggest if not already in place is the ability of the robot to converse with the other person playing."
"I suggest making the robot funny."
"make it smaller, takes up a lot of space"
"I do not. I think that the robot is very well equipped, and can provide significant entertainment and knowledge."
"Make it look more approachable."
"I don't have recommendations really"
"Reduce whirring noise. Maybe change the shape a bit? I am not sure what would be better exactly but it looks like a microscope. "
"the voice needs some semblance of emotion infused"
"I do not have any recommendations. "
"no I don't have any recommendation other than for the robot to be more visual."
"not entirely. maybe better movement speed or motions, not sure."
"It was a tad bit delayed in following along, but totally understandable."
"Major it smaller by make it hidden under the chess board"
"I am assuming you can talk to the robot. However if not, I would think this would be very helpful to implement."
"lets whinning sound "
"More human intonations in voice "
"Make the robot have human feeling to."
"More human design. It would also help if the robot had a whole hand rather than a 2 finger claw."
"It kind of talks a lot."
"I think that it could move a bit faster or have a HAL 9000 red dot to make it more immersive  "
"make it more fun, the robot isnt doing much and there no enthusiasm in the voicee"
"I think the voice sounds very dull snd monotonous "
"Maybe some form of digital screen would be nice to make it even more realistic."
"Perhaps make it more relevant, design wise, to the game. "
"less bulk or a quieter design"
"What other functions can it provide"
"N/A - I feel that it looks and works well"
"Make it easier to look at"
"Make it smaller so it would be more desirable to more households."
"It is quite large, so a smaller version could improve it."
"Seems like it is quite big and would take up a lot of space at home. It could provide the rationale for the alternatives proposed."
"not really. it looks like I would vison it would look like"
"make it look my aesthetically pleasing"
"Appear more human like."
"More engaging personality and voice. "
"Quieten it's movement. Smaller size particularly in height "
"Motor could be quieter"
"No I don’t have any recommendations "
"Less direct movements, humans can be perfect with there movements."
"I don’t know much about robots, maybe make it bigger and expand on its capabilities but so far it looks good"
"The voice, whilst clear, is very monotonous and quite boring. A little more variation in vocal tone would help keep me interested more."
"Possibly moving away from the clinical white and black all tech companies use. maybe going for cleaner or more fun colour schemes to make it more personal or to fit in other styles"
"Make the movements quieter."
"The movement noise I would find slightly annoying so I think if it was smoother without the start stop sort of motion "
"In the video it gave options to make several different moves. It may already be able to do this, but I think an option for randomizing the next move would be appealing to chess players. "
"Make it sleeker. Ensure that the audio is more sophisticated and natural."
"I couldn't understand why it was just talking about potential moves to make and then asking the user what it wants it to do - wouldn't the point of the robot be to replicate being an opponent? So telling it what moves to make would be no different than playing alone?"
"Go-faster stripes or other snazzy point job"
"A bit more fluidity in the way it speaks "
"make the movements smoother and ""robot-like"""
"Making it less bulky if possible "
"It's movements are a little slow, if it was quicker, it would be better."
"Make it so it can play other games."
"yeah dont make it sound so robotic, it has no personality"
"More visual components potential screens to show whats happening"
"Minimise movement noise and make robot sound more human"
"it depends on what we would like it to do. "
"it’s loud and large and probably wouldn’t fit into people’s lifestyles "
"I don't like the noise it makes when moving/rotating"
"I think if the robot were to show more emotion it would seem as if your talking to an actual human otherwise it shows that it is AI operated."
"Maybe give it a more personal or softer design."
"While very interesting, it could use more human features, maybe incorporate a face of some sort with expression"
"No, I do not know anything about robots unfortunately"
"i think it looks too much like a ""robot"". it would be better if it looked like something else. "
"Make it move faster. Can it do similes of human expression (thinking, pausing etc)?"
"It could be more fluid in its movements, if appears to be responding to programming, of course. But it would be more natural from a human perspective if this were less obvious. "
"I would make an improvement on the look of the robot, it seems very basic and boring."
"Not really. It would be cool if it had a screen on it so that it could put images up while it talked"
"The whirring sound as it moves is quite distracting"
"Perhaps you could offer some sort of custom colour according to  the owner's preference."
"not at this time. I really don't know what would improve it"
"Give it a face, to make it seem like we are interacting."
"What what it is designed for, i can't think of any improvements."
"A more fluid movement would be an improvement."
"Different type of claw"
"Make it come in multiple colors and different voices. "
"Improved versatility in terms of movement of the robot"
"No improvements necessary"
"With growing technology, smaller or portable versions of the robot might be more user friendly. "
"Don't use Gen AI, it's theft "
"Make it look less like a robot. Make it quiter."
"Having the option to have a male or female voice. The ability to customise. Perhaps making it a little smaller so it is could potentially be portable. "
"I do not have any recommendations"
"You could give it a more friendly and human look with a head, perhaps. This would make it easier to play a game with the robot if it was more of an equal."
"It's appearance looks quite clinical"
"no I think it is great as is"
"The voice of the ""AI"" is not wholly convincing. It comes across as too artificial for my taste. Improving the realism of the voice would help."
"More slim line. Even if the robot wasn’t a hand but was even in the board and could move the pieces from underneath "
"Improve the speech so it sounds more like a real person."
"make it smaller and a neater robot,"
"Could be smaller for home use."
"probably something that smaller in a human form"
"It should make decisions on its own. "
"Reducing the roboticness of the voice"
"Maybe a better design to make it look nicer/less robotic"
"Nope I am not a robotics engineer so I have no idea how to improve this"
"Motion & Control Enhancements:  If movements are jerky, refine motor control algorithms (e.g., PID tuning). If speed is inconsistent, optimize motion planning and actuator response. Stability & Balance Improvements:  For walking robots, improve weight distribution and use better gyroscopes/IMUs for balance. For wheeled robots, adjust wheel traction and suspension. Sensor & Perception Upgrades:  If the robot struggles to detect objects, enhance its cameras, LiDAR, or ultrasonic sensors. Improve sensor fusion to combine multiple data sources for better decision-making. "
"Lessen the noise when it moves if possible and maybe wrap it in something to imitate the appearance of a human arm and hand "
"No immediate recommendations, as do not know enough about the technology and it is not fair to judge by a short video. "
"I think it would be cool if you could change its voice to a female or different type of accent. Also at times I found its movements loud and speech hindered a bit"
"Maybe a screen showing a face,"
"I think if it didnt have any wires it would be cooler maybe a cooler design too"
"I thought it was decent but it seemed limited in range; I would have like to see more flexibility in motion. "
"Explain why one move may be better than another"
"Make it cheaper or else you will get a very small amount of rich chess lovers wanting this for home entertainment or a bar or restaurant using it for fun."
"I think a quieter motor to reduce the hum and buzz during movements, maybe a less clinical colour, something more neutral rather than a stark white."
"Reduce the size of the robot it looks intimidating."
"Don't believe so. It could be a little less tall, have a better movement capability."
"Give it more personality"
"Make the claw portion of the arm smaller and , where possible, aproach the pieces horizontally rather than from above."
"i don't have any recommendations"
"maybe make it more attractive looking "
"Not at all, i do not have any recommendations."
"The tone is very flat and the explanation itself feels a bit soulless, which I guess is just a result of it being trained through a chatGPT input. I feel for it to have a wider appeal, others may expect it to be more expressive."
"Perhaps give it various options for voices, such as female."
"Maybe make it more visually appealing or customizable. Let people choose the color. Also for those who can't hear, add captions somewhere on the robot that work like a teleprompter would. "
"No, I just don't like it. "
"I do not but robots are becoming much more smarter "
"Less movement noise."
"make it more human looking , and less sounds of movement when it is in motion"
"Just the appearance would need to be improved. Feel like there’s a lot of wires everywhere and exposed. "
"It could be made smaller and with quicker movement."
"The looks of the robot are strange. If it were a realistic hand maybe that would be more entertaining. "
"It could be more visually interesting "
"Less wires so better visually "
"Maybe try to make it more silent because it's pretty loud when it moves."
"The robot's voice could use a little work, it is not very pleasing to listen to. I think the arm could be much more smoother and less squeeling sounds."
"Seems fine to me! Maybe make it a bit more human with some humor?"
"If possible, limit the movement sounds as much as possible. Perhaps have a way to speed up the voice for those who are impatient, if that is also possible. "
"voice is very robotic"
"Make the model more compact and portable."
"maybe human looking "
"If it was more slimline it would suit a household better"
"I would the robot to be more flexible and more human like"
"I found the voice too monotone and difficult to listen to so a way to customise it's voice would improve it and give it more character."
"You can dress it up however you want, it'll still just be a creepy robot."
"It shouldn't touch a piece unless it is going to move it.  Basic rule."
"I guess it sounded a little noisy as it made the moves but that is probably expected. Perhaps a little less noisy moves might be a better experience. Excellent and clear communication from the robot. "
"I think the audio/speaking could be improved to sound less like a prerecorded message and more conversational to feel more ‘real’"
"I'm not sure but it seems like something with a smaller form factor and more flexible and less noisy movement would be good."
"Maybe less movement would be helpful. Heading all the way back to neutral before moving to the next piece makes it seem very unnatural and slow."
"Improve the design. It looks like a flailing robot arm. I'm sure there's a way to make it look more appealing."
"perhaps not so bulky"
"I feel changing the voice is a must. The more adventurous approach would to select a voice or an accent for the robot with a lot more character. "
"No, I hate them. As someone who has no interest in them whatsoever, I am the wrong age group to ask, so I shall leave that to my children and grandchildren. "
"the robot should also sit and have adjustable, e.g sometime player might prefer a silent robot"
"More human voice and a quieter motor"
"More human voice. Movements have mechanical unpleasant noise."
"If there's any way to lower the noise of the robot when it's moving, that would be the biggest complaint I have."
"A smaller version closer to the board and if there was some noise reduction in the movements it would be better for playing chess."
"The robot could also mention what would happen if the chess pieces moved to a certain spot. For example, if the Queen was place at b7, what could the opponent do?"
"Not really something I know much about"
"Give it a face, have it move faster and a more animated voice"
"Make it's movement silent and also perhaps a face where the mouth moves when talking. "
"No I have no recommendations"
"Higher spec motors that are faster, smoother and quieter when operating "
"potential improvements could be to improve the natural motion of the movements so it appears more user friendly and human-like when playing chess. and potentially make it more compact whilst also making the speech patterns more natural sounding. "
"Maybe it could look forward at some pints so it's not facing down all the time. This was it would connect with the user more."
"Maybe give it human features or a puppy"
"more life-like. Better inflexion of voice at the right times"
"I think if it was not so noisy and mechanical sounding . It could also look a little better , it just looks like quite an ugly bit of machinery and is not aesthetically appealing."
"no, i think that the robot is fully programmed and couldnt be better,altho advances come on board very quickly"
"how loud the motors are"
"not really, as it is not my specialty."
"I think make the robot smaller and maybe have a different shape so it is a big more conventional for the average home. "
"A smaller version of this could be more appealing "
"Unsure of any recommendations to improve the robot"
"I think it would be an improvement if the robot moved more quietly. A slightly smaller robot might make it easier to focus on the chessboard."
"Use a more natural, expressive voice with adjustable tones and personalities to suit different users."
"I would try and make the robot movements' noises quieter because I imagine they would get quite annoying."
"I don't have any opinions on the robot's performance."
"Make it more humanistic in appearance "
"Make it slimmer more appealing to look at. Show stopping AI"
"no. i am not in robotic. but if the robot had an expressive face. interacting with him would be even more entertaining"
"Not much but l believe it can be improved  aesthetically and make it more pleasing to the eye."
"Maybe change the colour of it"
"make it less annoying"
"Robot could be smaller it seems too big"
"Improve the look and sound of the robot."
"Implement better grip mechanisms to prevent pieces from slipping or being dropped"
"Maybe make it less 'stiff' use a more human voice."
"Make it look nicer, less robotic"
"Maybe try and make the movements faster, waste less time but otherwise. perfect"
"Not really but it could perhaps be slightly quieter when moving."
"Maybe some extra features /skills"
"It will have to compete against the smart chess board. "
"It's appearance is off putting."
"Have it hold itself without needing a clamp."
"The voice sounds unfriendly and lacks personality. "
"A little less 'robotic' and more human like may be better."
