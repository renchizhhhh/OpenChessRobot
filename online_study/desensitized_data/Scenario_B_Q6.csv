"R_80Deztc9VK2oTCx","Maybe change the words used, as they are quite technical and not everyone can understand what the robot means.","2"
"R_33SUIxyiGzpmoxP","No I do not have any recommendations about how to improve the robot. ","2"
"R_1qmWoMHnhpce1bX","You might make the voice more human, and make the robot's movements less noisy, and mechanical. ","2"
"R_51Es4U6LJcbQWhM","If you actually want to sell it to schools it needs to be cheaper and way more simple. That is a whole robot with massive amounts of technology required to operate and upkeep. A public school teacher will be lost.","2"
"R_1JQRZU3IUsIYnAP","Maybe a laser pointer to emphasize different squares that it's talking about without having to touch the board.","2"
"R_8TKWbdjs1BjkQPT","make the robot explain in a better way that the child can understan d, try trial and eroror witht he child to demonstrate principles","2"
"R_3zkznt2o2YAdllz","A little smaller.  More humanized voice","2"

"R_1KJwoPhrvDV9I7h","optimizing its movement speed and grip mechanism would make interactions smoother and more efficient, improving the overall user experience.","2"
"R_5pbSouhp2lQRoAz","Maybe use a more human voice.","2"
"R_2n7zbZ0dxZe7WWJ","The rotating head cut my attention and I believe it should be improved not to hit a player when the robot is playing with a human ","2"

"R_77m3JC9Wm0RSkWi","The elimination of the robot arm and replacing it with something else could be interesting, maybe a magnet-based board that can move the individual pieces around could be interesting","2"
"R_1thXWKTbm2VM6Nz","A more engaging manner. ","2"
"R_5v8LOOyZFrPv63D","I think it is overall bulky in a way which makes the chess movement harder to see.","2"
"R_256cMob4B7HLh73","As well as pointing at the square, maybe it could be clear by shining a weak laser at it?","2"
"R_2YzjrkxZ8C2T8ya","The voice could be more engaging, and could explain what some of the more technical words mean.","2"

"R_2vjiQ5DEgz9epqx","The noise when the arm moves could be quieter","2"
"R_8NQaogNEgdWH9as","Talk about considering various different options to allow for wider range of play; also explaining why moves are bad would also be a good talking point to allow for improvement in gameplay.","2"

"R_20q0nn1sHJYamyw","I don't have any recommendations at this time.","2"
"R_3xzXggFb8gnmA7f","Make it quieter somehow. Include absolute starter lessons-show how pieces move. Described the rules. Go over the board. Maybe even adjust it so it is more ""eye level"" as opposed to being up high. ","2"
"R_8RV73S0CyAHvWaf","It needs to be much smaller and far less noisier.","2"
"R_84l9p6dXPLiibyK","Maybe have a human-like face on the robot","2"

"R_5sdNem1ZBQi5Tgm","Nope it seems to be doing well in this video showing how to do this","2"
"R_8G7PFWlYbalcCiJ","no, very good, maybe if the camera was filming from above so that the people can see what squares are being used.","2"
"R_8ivPgZUm8yYYiAw","Maybe a different section to pick the opponent side to help teach chess better. sound could also be reduced potentially, although thats a very small thing. It also moved a couple of times without touching a piece, not sure why.","2"
"R_7a8g7bmJvvNd3p1","Not really. It seems effective in doing what it's supposed to do. Maybe if it did other things along with chess it would be an improvement but I'm not sure what.","2"
"R_2kIaGdeMjy0XoxJ","Quieter! It's very noisy. I like the way it explains everything ","2"
"R_1kB3t6juYRaKDqD","no, I know nothing about robots...","2"
"R_2PALTK7BM4F5H6e","Not necessarily an improvement because I don't know if this is already implemented, but some of the terminology the robot was using seems quite advanced, It would be helpful if there was also an option more beginner friendly for inexperienced chess players","2"
"R_2eXz8jSqGsZnmdW","interactive with the student","2"

"R_5rjFMfjqBDDWk4J","Improve speed, add voice instructions, and enhance AI difficulty levels for better learning.   ","2"
"R_5zZnxLMm5gTmCha","no i do not have any recomendations.","2"
"R_8mKkGlKda02v0Bu","If it was used for teaching, instead of just saying what the move is and what the name of the strategy is, it should be more clear about why it would make certain moves. It could also give specific recommendations of tactical moves depending on what the opponent has done in their turn.","2"
"R_4mEq9Jfymd2aSu4","Make the voice less robot like and more human. It makes a lot of noise when moving. It would be great if it could also answer chess questions.","2"
"R_20JJo0rEt4h96Qs","unsure as I don't play chess. ","2"
"R_82wXXYU2vK4TqUh","Perhaps a more human friendly look? Not necessarily a cgi human talking but if it's for children it might be worth having an animated mascot","2"
"R_3OIUMZPak1rWUaU","The robot would be less robotic if it had a hand.","2"
"R_6QMoGIDt4vMmuWi","May be a humanoid robot.","2"

"R_3E0JA91AB8cQB4e","The sound quality could be better","2"
"R_279XLEE08mj4Fgt","Maybe if it had some sort of light / lazer it could shine on the other squares that it is talking about to indicate other potential moves or squares under attack etc","2"
"R_2IQTCJABeGsZk69","no i like it, i think it’s good","2"
"R_2BzJvpBVVEtsFuU","I think it is is designed very well for its purpose. Hopefully there are other modes in which a student could play against the machine.","2"
"R_6oCq0z119Rlj4so","add a communication function ","2"
"R_2Mslwr0yHE2jb0t","There is nothing to improve about it","2"
"R_65KfUmUiarHq2RZ","less noise, smaller, more humanoid but that is tricky","2"
"R_5veHTaLqtxoTzBD","Not really. Movements are fluid. Explanations are good. ","2"
"R_3r00YMfvKorcXC5","Put a head on the robot and maybe some hands like a robot made for a robot","2"
"R_8duB66xog5TTzTJ","Use a less robotic voice.","2"
"R_4NaWwBnSYHEO44n","Make it quieter when it moves.","2"
"R_2rN4MQPM6lEFNXK","It looks like a piece of machinery, it would be great if it looked less technical and more ‘friendly’.","2"
"R_2jDMsLTPUoBKefP","No, its good as is, I don't really have any improvements to suggest","2"
"R_7Bvn53DRUL8jCH7","Make it more human-like.","2"
"R_4rIlAi58LTU86Vl","See above, more a recommendation about the commentary than the robot. Perhaps some kind of pointer light as an indicator of the square being discussed?","2"
"R_19OGNf2KjdlZ345","It's not a very relaxed voice but more like the one describing a very combat activity.","2"
"R_6sYyVlLhG4zivNk","Move faster and more fluid.","2"
"R_82z7P5pdPBdQNfm","I would like to see someone asking the robot questions & seeings it's response ","2"

"R_2flGXlDTqiBltND","Maybe try and quieten the movement of the robot.","2"
"R_5HT75J4iPtDbVTV","Add more dialogue on why you would move in that way. ","2"
"R_5e2F8T8LtRR6044","Make it more humanoid and interactive","2"
"R_2DXR9Cfab2S5Wwu","Yes make it look more like human","2"
"R_6EBaNsH85uiWNKx","See above, already mentioned it.","2"
"R_1CKF57SkvbWhFPg","maybe color around the boxes","2"
"R_2sYbdmGorjXQQ4J","Perhaps slowing down the explanation? This isn’t a true criticism, some students may benefit from that though so they can take notes. A setting for this could be useful. ","2"
"R_6i2pn4IWXr9qqDo","have it respond to questions that people audibly ask","2"
"R_22hvEi0o9sNQjPI","It could look more appealing, perhaps with a chess like theme. ","2"
"R_80nMekUcyui4TZL","Maybe for teaching, give more move options and reasons why some are better than other for different strategies.","2"
"R_13kDkWm77hDXRdT","Giving chances to play at different events with different age groups.","2"
"R_4q7LdYmlooFmcvh","In order for schools to be able to use this robot to teach students chess the robot will need to be able to interact with students. In particular, it will need to be able to answer their questions.","2"
"R_7fQ38iuwAa0QHPu","Probably a difficult engineering task, but muffle the motor a bit. ","2"
"R_74dDo4vhxK8dhfJ","it could talk more naturally","2"
"R_28MbrvitCuDqsRK","make the voice more lifelike","2"
"R_8JIXPiwrTAf4ava","Implement AI that adjusts to the student’s skill level. 	•	Provide real-time explanations for moves instead of just playing them. 	•	Offer hints instead of outright suggestions to encourage thinking.  2. Voice and Interactive Feedback 	•	Add voice narration to explain strategies, openings, and tactics. 	•	Allow students to ask questions and get verbal responses. 	•	Use a touchscreen or app integration for additional learning materials.","2"
"R_23ZVxWqUKSrfDOo","The only recommendation would be that the robot should be open to questions and available for questions like why should i make this move, or would this move be better.","2"
"R_7ef8mgsmZgDMXSR","The robot should be able to communicate in different languages and also different kinds of spoken English. I think it should be made more attractive/visually appealing. I did not like the look of it in general nor the colour.","2"
"R_544kr69KL5XmMnv","Not at all, it is already interesting enough","2"
"R_8hc1QSdrr7qNB2M","the robot could be remodel in human form. A robotic human","2"
"R_43xnPUDIzs5UFtk","I woudl say however, that mentioning the Sicilian Defence without an explanation of what that is, it's pros and cons is missing.","2"
"R_2TYwgLdFvo17Cr2","no i dont currently have any recommendation because a lot is ongoing in regards to this already","2"
"R_84O6XFfrNVijZ7z","I’m not keen on the whirring noise it makes. Other than that I can’t see any faults with it.","2"
"R_7tGrP60fLLUdve5","Have it feel a little more personable. ","2"
"R_1OuD9B2aVMvzl6y","It needs to be more descriptive and simpler. Especially in an elementary or middle school, students will quickly get bored and frustrated if the concepts cannot be explained simply. Right now, the language seems a little odd and not very humanlike (e.g. ""exert influence"").","2"
"R_2UBGZx6nCK3Mda1","robot should be more explanatory especially for new users","2"
"R_8ARwzzqhePmpiU2","maybe change appearance of robot to make it more human-like.","2"
"R_7Ca4kXhHNpWaLI0","Not really, I think it is pretty good as is","2"
"R_4FJozkt6yM1dy6E","Perhaps silencing the robotic movements, if possible.","2"
"R_30enTHfRetujlby","Perhaps make it sound a little friendlier.","2"
"R_21jipFCVUzlyBk4","I cant think of anything","2"
"R_23fqE7p9Pqwcmht","i dont know  but technolgy will better it soon","2"
"R_18CYBF0mJ6G0eKz","For the purpose of teaching in schools, I think this robot is teaching at too high a level. If it doesn't already, it should be able to adapt to the individual learner's level, whether they are a beginner or advanced player. The robot should also have the ability to respond to questions. For example, I needed more clarification on the Sicilian manuever, so I would want to ask about that. ","2"
"R_7DJChpilD4WBrJ7","Not at this time, the video was very short","2"
"R_9OlbKkfyA3JYW9P","Probably dont use it for teaching ","2"
"R_2K3fZZX056phOhz","Maybe the robot should not be as tall and white looking, Does not look particularly friendly for a school environment","2"
"R_1sbVAEKsoeaucsP","It was very concise. I don’t have any recommendations ","2"
"R_4DZ0SwgcPoLSPob","I like the communication/verbose it gives while playing however I think if this was to be present in schools its vocab should be dialed down as kids may not understand what it is saying if they are novice chess players.","2"
"R_8HSJGxWGMdqPBYd","Make it more appealing and less industrial ","2"
"R_5gGRaALZjWAc6rf","It would be nice if the voice sounded less robotic, and if the language used wasn't quite so 'stiff', if it sounds more natural it would be an improvement.","2"
"R_2M0dicBc3VqO8uf","To make it more interesting (especially in schools and kids) it could be designed like a hand instead of normal grippers. Also the robot could have multiple voice options.   ","2"
"R_3xRZ4NtFqII38bg","Make the operation quieter, make the voice more pleasant ","2"
"R_8qkgMxtw3k4rIpH","Cannot think of anything","2"
"R_31TvfwohANbhw8q","Well definitely we can add more stuff to it as it is handy.","2"
"R_6YXPkMzQ1eSkWuB","The robot is fairly good but would overall ;just need to improve its language skills with time.","2"
"R_6dG1K2jzV9se34u","No I can’t think of anything at the moment ","2"
"R_6dj3cOfND0W33eB","If the whirring sounds could be eliminated when it actually moves, it looks like a robot, but it sounds even more like one when it moves, which makes the voice, not quite fitting. ","2"
"R_8Cki7GpXEIci8NT","Increase accuracy when robot is pointing at a specific square. Possibly change the voice to one that fits the robot better.","2"
"R_7ozdVWPJhM5LvPz","Depending on the level of futurism you are striving for, possibly playing upon a smart screen, to allow for visuals to be displayed on the table would be an additional great concept.","2"
"R_6LSeev8X0ykhxS6","capability to answer questions","2"
"R_4nfnwzkVMZpIumC","Add a laser pointer to the arm so that when it is highlighting a particular square for a certain move you can determine which square its referencing easier.","2"
"R_7incRtwkTMI5DeK","If the robot uses chatgpt and can answer questions and show different scenarios or outcomes on the board, then I do not have any recommendations. ","2"
"R_1ifEIt6S98Rj7sC","No recommendations. It was a very nice show. ","2"
"R_5v0JfEUOuMud7ph","Improve the text-to-speech to sound more natural. The sound it makes when it moves seems like it could get annoying, so try to reduce that.","2"
"R_2gBgh1zh135ctbV","No, i have no knowledge on robots","2"
"R_8OTLMh8JaB0XjD6","No, the demonstration seems pretty good.","2"
"R_2lbJ7Wy3nGLbmMn","if its used for learnings, give suggestions on moves for the opponent","2"
"R_2ONlD0oX7HFe8qP","Show alternative moves before committing?","2"
"R_1JbaXDoxh6AKNVZ","Maybe go a little slower and show the move very slow.","2"
"R_6AGwkQ7YF8QddUu","Minimizing the robot's movements when the AI provides reasoning for a move would make it less distracting. ","2"
"R_2CDu3O8TwNgAheP","Work on giving it a more natural tone of voice.","2"
"R_3irIMsWwCExz0W2","Aesthetically, it lacks some personality. A screen/face or ""eyes"" would make it more personable.","2"
"R_1disSmMcyIcETHQ","Firstly, to aid in showing what square is being described the robot, I believe it would be helpful for the robot to have an attached light source that would highlight the square in question once the robot's arm moves over that square. Secondly, I heard recently about ChatGPT may be able to have more human sounding voices based on user input. Maybe, the robot could be taught to use a voice that is familiar to the students, such as of a popular celebrity, or their teacher. I think this would help the robot to be more familiar and engaging, as the robotic voice may sound a bit dull. To build on this, giving the robot a human name may help keep children engaged with the learning. ","2"
"R_8SqOEs0sfvBDoQH","First and foremost, make sure every move they talk about is being played. I would also give more information about the meaning and the idea of an opening rather then just stating its name.","2"
"R_8NrAAq2xt9ZyWeZ","Maybe if there were 2 robots, each making the moves for one side, whether white or black.","2"
"R_2CQaCP9aQjaKAaK","It could do with speaking a bit more smoothly and not leaving large gaps between some of its sentences(0:24-0:27). Maybe it could allow a human to make moves in response and explain the positives and negatives of those moves rather than playing both sides as this could help someone learn from experience.","2"
"R_8gBJsRLGo7bkr85","The answer is as above","2"
"R_54fayvdTk11jPoy","A female voice and an accent that is fit to the student demographic","2"
"R_2q8KRW6z4U8rM1K","If this robot is geared towards teaching younger students (i.e., children) how to play chess, it should probably be made a little more approachable - perhaps by giving it a name, or lightly anthropomorphising it. ","2"
"R_6VrDez8DDOBSmn7","Not really, I think its affective and can communicate very well","2"
"R_80o8rchxJlxKx5n","No, the robot seems to be doing fine. It is slightly slow but that is also fine.","2"
"R_8CeSUPSYbb9U5QC","may be needs a bit of colour rather than a clinical looking white, may be even a friendly face if aimed at using in schools","2"
"R_1FkyHNKN4Hjm8SS","if it is a natural conversation tone, it would be better","2"
"R_3fxUWqRawVA6DVT","Make it less machine like. ","2"

"R_2dHaUnJWcXC3105","Clearer voice quality ","2"
"R_2k1FWeKstaYwmwO","The voice is a bit emotionless, and essentially, robotic, but hard to know how to improve that without it not being a robot.","2"
"R_8KSByQ7nj4nX4UH","The sound of the robotic arms are loud and this noise might be distracting. The robot could also be more human like in appearance.","2"
"R_8PfmdhsLNU2Waqd","To give more information on why they think the opponent has chosen to make the move they did.","2"
"R_5170IxzMVySbbfY","Improving contextual awareness and explanation depth would significantly enhance its usefulness. Allow users to ask follow-up questions (e.g., ""Why not move the rook instead?""). Offer difficulty settings (basic explanations for beginners, deeper analysis for advanced players).","2"

"R_2PU0e4rqsrlKK9H","None I don’t think the robot needs improvements at the moment ","2"
"R_2arj0nNO9q5nguw","The robot describes what it's doing but does not do much explanation so I don't see the value","2"
"R_8bV30ixbJwGcVPv","Perhaps it could be a little quieter in its movements. I'm not sure how easy this would be to do though. It could also look somewhat smaller and/or more 'friendly' and 'human-like' if it were indeed to be used in a school setting. Particularly for younger users who may find such a robot more engaging. The voice could also be a little less mechanical and more friendly for younger users.","2"
"R_3YKYRTAAudWRaH3","No not at all................","2"
"R_3neKTqklEw8077r","Provide more context and definitions. For example, expand on the Sicilian Defence. What exactly is that? The move suggestions are impactful, but the robot is missing the ""what"" and ""why""","2"
"R_2CAXvOZclUnhkg5","It looks a little like dentistry equipment. If it's possible to make it a little smaller or covered, to make it look a little less stark and unfriendly for children.","2"
"R_8Lil2JAe65ofPka","The robot could explain some of the moves in more simple language.","2"
"R_2FkMa3exvAElUQb","No. The robot seems perfectly capable but i a bit extravegent just for teaching a game.","2"
"R_8THGToN58NR6pBU","It should start with a simple and comprehensive move. ","2"
"R_4NvNuKocRkisW9K","Maybe make it smaller and improve the design. ","2"
"R_1efVMveFQleVFiq","From an esthetic perspective, it looks rather ""clinical"" and unfriendly. I think if it's to be used in an educational setting, it could look more toy-like (lit-up screen with eyes and a moving mouth when it speaks).","2"
"R_3effLHLpIa8DsS6","It may be a little smaller and wireless so that it can be used or given chess classes in different places.","2"
