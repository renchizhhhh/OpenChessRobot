R_8FWlrwL9VWbkqlK,"It's possible, but I would need to see code along with the explanation.",neutral
R_7QzNPdA4ydCELbH,Maybe in some scenarios but not all. I think it would be good to teach certain visual to people in a classroom as addition to screens.,neutral
R_5Kxqw6pc9qG2EH5,"Possibly, but I think people could benefit from learning from both.",neutral
R_3LKiyRiEJRSupO1,I do. I feel that their are various situations were have to read something on a screen does not explain as well as a person point things out. A robot like this could replicate that experience.,positive
R_3Nqfuz1chvegwPK,"Maybe. I don't really know what your asking. I think computers will still have a place in educating people in 10 years. I'm sure robots will also have a role, but not sure they'll be a replacement for computers altogether.",neutral
R_678dUIkcKNYxvdD,This robot cannot replace because people have questions and may need something explained again unless they can make it respond to human responses ,negative
R_7QEYdofdTUlkztS,"Yes I agree, if society can develop an open-minded standpoint on the use of technology.",positive
R_61tvN6Hic4Z1pcI,"It is possible that robots like this could replace screen-based computers to understand technical topics. It would depend on the specific technology and how it performs. I think there will always be a use for screen-based computers, however.",neutral

R_5Ez1xFTJCrX4zo2,"Yes, robots are more precise and accurate than a human. They would make less mistakes.",positive
R_2jfdWtRfiRe9O2o,"no; i think that AI isn't going to advance enough to be useful and that it will go on a similar trajectory to blockchain eventually, at least the LLM version that is being pushed right now.",negative
R_8pgtObTWHl2jvIK,"yes, could point to things to assist",positive
R_8aE4Lsd2nQyZJeM,Yes because it ensures physocslly engaging. It is very important especially for beginners. Because it includes different sense at the same time,positive
R_8HH6aUkhjLUl3rz,"no, i dont think a arm robot can explain everything",negative
R_1WLvcZ0J3qMrhlf,I dont think so it would be too expensive,negative
R_22K23E4qpv8LTbR,I feel that this kind of robot won't as it won't be one that humans can relate to easily. Such information is also easier to take in on a screen as well.,negative
R_8oRVOGdkNwpFchj,"yes, it seems as they are being developed more and more every year and becoming smarter",positive
R_2wROtZf2wYZqOhH,"Yes, AI is evolving so quickly I see no reason why robots cannot replace many computer functions.",positive
R_8CsupRsHUkzp8wc,"I don't think so, I think people will still be using screens on phones and TV's and tablet, so I can't see that disappearing within a decade.",negative
R_11B8B59TLUA2Fba,Mayne but I'm really not sure because I know that maybe there could be some tech errors,neutral
R_23vVQwWwBNitwIL,In some aspects yes for physical demonstration however the overall cost and benefits to do so are not strong enough as other existing and implemented technologies are already doing a decent job ,neutral
R_8l3v7bvHix7cwus,"I hope not, well not altogether atleast. It's very odd and impersonal. It's a clever idea but the one tone robot voice just makes me uninterested from the start. ",negative
R_8h45Bl2rBd4YokF,definetley if it gets more advanced and developed ,positive
R_6WTh5fkmmju4rMe,"Absolutely, this provides a clear, real-life situation and how the robot behaves/interprets data. Some students may have difficulties visualizing such concepts without a live model before them. ",positive
R_2dEwWncOsNM4aHb,"Yes. I think the rate at which technology, particularly AI is developing, this is a strong possibility. ",positive
R_22L4X9u1jRrfLHR,Yes as they are more interactive ,positive
R_4g7PgQAEpdy447j,I don't think so because I don't think within ten year people will accept it. It will take longer than that to condition people to accept these robots.,negative
R_2KDSAYY7XD3fw0n,"maybe so, they are still a bit clunky looking, so i think they would have to work smoother",neutral
R_8hFRJfA66RqH0ml,"Maybe, maybe not. I think screen-based computers with videos have the capacity to show show more content and nuanced details.",neutral
R_2ygQRwc1Wa704KJ,"no, , it would always be useful for people to see a map of what a computer is doing to understand the thought process.",negative
R_2e37qssbFbfwvcs,This robots could definitely serve as a replacement because of how it will be able to easily explain orally and also show how the concept works,positive
R_7thPITBGj8oR24n,I absolutely think they can replace convention screen base computers in a few years because people do not want to work anymore,positive
R_24PvrUshd27PTyx,I think it could be a possibility but it seems very costly and I'm not sure what new or enhanced features would be added that it would be necessary to invest in these robots to replace existing computers that work fine.,neutral
R_50qjFKeDpFOb2cV,"Its possible yes, the prototype already displays a vision where one could conceive that this would be possible within the next 10 years. But it would likely take AI progressing as fast as it is now to achieve this.",neutral
R_82suoiCIdhtPLiC,Technically yes. But with the drive for ever more compact devices it would seem counter productive,neutral
R_2oiHNNtkmJE6Km0,No - I still think it is important for humans to have high rates of involvement in these scenarios.,negative
R_1qsQZ6gQ4kFlmjT,"I believe they could help along side a screen based computer to help establish both a visual and kinetic means of learning for those that benefit over one or the other, however I don’t think a complete replacement would help in the teaching process. ",negative
R_1iufT7b6KSzCazL,I don't think so because we can just use an ai system that doesn't take up too much space.,negative
R_8gBeOiczOHl0yWa,highly unlikely there is still a long way to go including affordability compared to computers ,negative
R_3QURtGKcCUfdu0h,"Maybe, it is quite possible.",neutral
R_6rDB82KkvmrnTGa,"I hope not. AI in and of itself is a great tool, but the fact nobody Really knows how it works and that it IS making up it's own language..scary stuff. The termiinator coming to life for real",negative
R_8t9i4ToV1MasOGt,"In some way, the robot will probably still need more input to understand what is required in order to explain well to other people ",neutral
R_8zbVEVVcPAe2rLZ,Unlikely to replace screen-based computers given the current need for those computers which is unlikely to go away. The robots don't have the same reason to be scaled. ,negative
R_2uzhAM7oexIg1Rn,"It would be nice, but probbaly not cost-effective to do, compared to screen-based learning. Screen are already widely available, and can deliver a wide range of content or services. ",negative
R_49jLRMZcGtAylhf,"Probably, but seems excessive",neutral
R_2DYm4DeSRv1Z0tW,Possibly. Very practical. But expensive.,neutral
R_202cppqL762UObI,"yes most definitely, i believe AI and robotics are the future",positive
R_8PdvFvLEeaZYmqd,"Yes, I think to have a moving object in the room would be very engaging ",positive
R_8PgRQO83X89zHzI,"Yes, technology is moving so fast each yeah I can see them helping us learn so many different things ",positive
R_4IFreW6M14cS3NT,Yes because seeing a real world example in real life can give students a better and deeper understanding on certain more nuanced and complicated topics,positive
R_3LLpjM6koKX9sMg,"Possibly, but screens are accessible at all times while robots may not be.",neutral
R_8CwtPjfrWH1PuvO,"Probably will yes, but they will get more interesting",neutral
R_8LC0HISRqHFcE4d,"Maybe, I think in that case they should be interacting with the viewers.",neutral
R_2TZ4gmDqAuinsiH,"No, I believe a human will always be better at explaining misconceptions that a robot may not pick up on",negative
R_8J1UOPpkaZKAtep,I think so. But at the result of negative impact on humanity.  ,neutral
R_2IzJKpiro5McpuR,Yes as there is a decline in teaching jobs and also students are not learning with some teachers,positive
R_2szfNwsCWzopt3B,"No, some students may not engage with a talking voice and instead learn by doing",negative
R_23mBFKrau9dzj3K,Yes because it is much easier to understand with a real-life scenario as an example.,positive
R_8SW8wR0XkmmmCiJ,Possible yes with how technology is evolving and progressing ,neutral
R_6fxq6Jbh4RuJ65X,"I think for certain things it can, however for some people working with a robot could be quite intimidating but over the next ten years we will likely get used to working with this kind of technology",neutral
R_8p0dy1rnLWqa9ch,It could be used to supplement learning. It wouldn't be a replacement as screen based computers have videos and more ways of learning such as various apps.,negative
R_8aLBXEZkV349qPK,"I don't think so, the expense would be too great. Robots would also need to be pitched to the receiving audience, ie not be too complicated to understand",negative
R_8QQlzgDuzRkNyf8,"They might as they could show more physical understanding of the topics than would be able to be shown through a computer screen, allowing the person using the understand more clearly ",neutral
R_3dtqVOunTsZnHkO,No this robot is too advanced ,negative
R_7vrVeZ8fSb2iox3,"Yes and no. Yes it would be nice to have a robot at hand but people seem to work, and learn better with actual human interaction. ",neutral
R_1O6SHMbN5T3E7K2,"Absolutely, people have different learning types, and robots like this can help simplify and explain things for people who would rather look and learn from a robot rather than other alternatives. ",positive
R_3OqXAWc2hJRfWhj,"Yes, it's definitely can replace current screen based computers. It's going to be better as it can demonstrate the topics that it's explaining in an entertaining engagement way.",positive
R_54kferJTy9qTgzf,No it is too expensive.,negative
R_8ho9KtbEqFcCFTR,no you need human interaction as people see and understand things differently,negative
R_2mxiQ6obKuyib1P,"No, as I don't think it is always necessary for a robot when a computer screen would give sufficient information.",negative
R_2JCWG0PB6B7JBl0,Yes it brings the explanation to life when the robot can move and describe its own actions and processes,positive
R_1CKmaJXJxmA2uVw,"I think for some people who are auditory leaners, this could be a great alternative to text based learning. That being said, as people learn in many different ways, I don't personally see robots such as this completely replacing screen based models.",negative
R_7PpStFSG5EnF08V,They could because they are so advanced already.,positive
R_2SUyGZQgdtjmB3z,"No, because while the technology is still developing fast, people get sceptical and end of the day, humans develope robots. ",negative
R_5P6xNOoIp9cQ41p,I have no particular input on this issue. ,neutral
R_8iWi6Q4Vec15PpP,Partly but I don't think they could completely replace screen based computers. They could be an excellent replacement in technical areas. Especially demonstrating physical actions.,neutral
R_32kae309HOf4c6t,The words spoken by the robot were concise and  understandable. But words alone would not be an ideal teaching tool - they should be accompanied by some sort of visual aid.,neutral
R_6lyE2aRuPqRfoR8,"Absolutely, yes. They will be able to teach and instruct all subjects.",positive
R_7M2EkpIw7LDkgQ9,yes because a lot of advancement is coming in the next 10 years.,positive
R_8MT2e1bNofM7BYz,"I'm not entirely sure. I think it would certainly help explain things because of the fact that it can express, through movements, what it's trying to explain. Like how humans use our arms etc to emphasise points. However having a screen can mean showing so much more to help visualise aspects of conversations and topics.",neutral
R_20Nyw7fWaQpObfY,I think it would take longer to adopt such technology in the workplace ,neutral
R_9fejUROz26yL3rg,Sure they can. They are evolving fast and will a more common form of interaction.,positive
R_2nGVMCLqtI0x5cs,"I do partly believe so as some people are visual learners, and so seeing it happen in front of their eyes and described step by step may help students to learn more effectively.",neutral
R_1rjEXtNIRxXXqks,It would be too difficult to remove screens. Everyone on Earth gets their information from screens in some for and most do not trust robots.,negative
R_8kdIjjwap8QlDcp,I very much think so. I am cautious about them replacing human workers however in AI I believe they are perfectly fit and useful..,positive
R_2tmJB5CoCE6WMiV,Robots like this could be useful but I’d see this being way more advanced in 10 years so maybe they’d be obsolete. ,neutral
R_8p3vVBfJy0Roc3J,"They will to an extent, however, they will be significantly more expensive ",neutral
R_8FLYQrJHbpeqZSZ,Yes. By interacting with physical objects the robots represent human dynamics more easily and its operations can be more clearly understood.,positive
R_1Oy8bRIzJQR51Fr,They should be able to replace screen-based systems though it is unclear about the cost involved. An 8000-dollar robot doesn't seem as useful as a 30-dollar program,neutral
R_30f5U6w60iM93JD,No because that is very complicated,negative
R_4qyuhOpAv1pDb5I,"I hope not - I think it gets rid of the written words for people to read to understand topics, could be used for kinestic and auditory learners",negative
R_1afQB5m6jBvqgNP,"Not really, this is more expensive than computers, has little value to general personal users ",negative
R_6QDtZGLLsEtrPI5,"NO. I believe that being totally autonomous is against human nature, and humans want to preform tasks themselves to ensure there are no mistakes",negative
R_2IQcXIbbogDw2w0,yes but robots like this can also be used in conjunction with screen-based computers as i think they both have their pros and cons,neutral
R_5Iyf6rPzSgWh1VV,Potentially yes as it seems a lot more interactive. ,neutral
R_2OcWZE5dOzmAge2,"I think they can, but not in the time-frame. I think we're 20-30 years away from that",negative
R_1B5nbwHhWv5DQgX,"That thought really scares me. Yes, I do think they will have the capability to replace computers- but at what cost? Are robots going to phase human reliance out of existence? I don't really know a whole heck of a lot about computer vision but I know that the technological advances in robotics is astounding.",neutral
R_3OJi71bedx9M6EX,Yes. 10 years is a long time in tech to get all the gimmicks in the right places to make robots feel more real and personal to everyone.,positive
R_8zdqNmleiEd0xrP,No because they move too quickly ,negative
R_6Blzb0bED9W94iy,I think this is very possible and very exciting.,positive
R_3FUsjIYWarUkUww,Yes if the cost is right but I think it is an unnecessary demo that can be shown on 2D screen already ,neutral
R_7xVkmT4BNtYI4Y3,"no, robots should not replace anything",negative
R_8dFgplArAmn6f3Z,No. Robots scare me. ,negative
R_1JgTtvz5mg1hug9,"yes, I think robots with replace screen based computers",positive
R_9ZPso0RlDBUMy9M,"I firmly believe that in 10 years, it will have evolved so much that it will become more human-like. Its capability will be just as good or more advanced than we can imagine.",positive
R_8hEJi55VJjeUtYY,I do not think they could serve as a total replacement. Being able to showcase technologies like computer vision using a robot arm is more of an additional piece of equipment to help make people understand certain technologies in a more physical capacity.,negative
R_8Y8zZryy3GktQop,"I think certain fields that require physical effort would be good areas to replace screen-based computers, however things that can be demonstrating purely through vision wouldn't be applications for robots like this",neutral
R_6kyTpCCu9GYoPbo,"Yes, but I think it still needs human touch as it would be boring with only a robot",neutral
R_8ds4i0d09CqUCqF,"I don't think they could replace computers within 10 years. I think simple human input by touch/typing will still be relevant, and perhaps preferred by most people.",negative
R_7MSfiIjIEKxasoJ,"While robots like this could make learning more interactive, they are unlikely to fully replace screen-based computers in the next 10 years. Computers still offer greater flexibility for complex tasks, but robots can complement education by providing hands-on experience and real-world applications.",negative
R_6oZ1Pr3CVGah1x1,These robotic systems will improve hands-on education but cannot accomplish the complete replacement of screen-based computing technology during the coming decade. The use of computers represents an improved method of teaching advanced computational topics since they deliver flexible teaching approaches at reduced costs with scalable implementation for students. ,negative
R_3GzqGQWzIqpd0Od,"I think it needs to be more fun if you are going to use it to teach kids.  Yes, the robot is cool, but he talks way above their level.",neutral
R_82ijMrop95eDmdU,"Yes, if done correctly this is possible. Actually seeing something in real life making real-life movements makes teaching easier. ",positive
R_8jP7lYMKLjFr3eU,"I'm not sure a robot like this one would replace screen-based computers. Computers seem much more versatile, capable of a wide range of activities related to a wide range of topics - they are more flexible to the changing needs of education, whereas this robot or similar ones seem more limited in their scope.",negative
R_5rqoPufiRLCioNg,Yes because it is interactive and you could ask it questions and it would answer.,positive
R_6BY9LMBt0RUtaRr,"I would not think so.  This robot is just a task oriented robot and could not replace screens.  To illustrate a few tasks that robot could do and why they are doing them is good for this type of robot, but i don't think it is capable of replacing screen based computers",negative
R_5Gp7ANM4bxQFhIY,"In my opinion, it really depends on the costs. If the cost is low then I don't see why this cannot be an alternative. It also depends on how effective it is for students to learn this way. ",neutral
R_2usyONwCihXdJtA,Probably not because the screen based computers still will be cheaper version and probably 3d hologram will be more useful than robots for educational purposes ,negative
R_8gqOn0LrTueDJ7h,To teach people how things might get repaired or put back together. ,neutral
R_1rrcFF1idPhXls8,"I don't think so. It would be too costly, and I don't think there will be enough improvement in the next 10 years where that will be necessary.",negative
R_21MZDKL60dVHwOg,"It could be a possibility, but some learners might find it more difficult to follow as they might be visual learner and need text to follow. It could work well for a kinaesthetic learner. ",neutral
R_8A0yZomS94xeg5I,Yes because visual learning is easier to take in and remember ,positive
R_2soGsZ2CGTpI5mB,Depends on the cost mainly. Screen based computers are probably more diverse,neutral
R_84jhlDod0FuX33e,"Yes, with further development I believe that this is very likely to be the case as robots will be able to explain well and clearly, including tailoring their language and complexity to people of differing abilities. ",positive
R_8FRL08nVzOOpndM,"Probably not. Seems slightly impractical, I still think a screen will be the dominant form.",negative
R_85zF5gLA2nmc43D,Yes because I think hands on models would be a better teaching aid than screen based ones,positive
R_8C2PvHhW0Gy3CqJ,"Yes, it could save time in terms of the computer booting process ",neutral
R_3EEDZLMPcORClAP,"For some people, especially those who are vision impaired, I can see that being very useful. But in general, I can't imagine people preferring a 3D object like a robot to screens. Part of that is because we haven't replaced books with something 3D.",negative
R_21uL6vEDPUtjdB5,Yes. They can offer hands on learning and teaching of technical concepts. ,positive
R_8GUsHgw3yA4XSMN,"I think probably not, but they could help enhance learning or more probably help with engagement of certain topics. The reason for not is due to the robot being able to demonstrate one or two specific parts of a topic where a screen can essentially show you anything.",negative
R_7dG3vBQOVnSkfxT,I guess so. The explanation was a little technical and it didn't really use any visual aids in exaining how it works. I think a screen based explanation could use more visuals in the explanation to make it clearer.,neutral
R_3QflQlhJ7fJfD74,maybe i am not sure if it is practical,neutral
R_2EhweLRd4IORk6F,This could help in a future. The question would be how much interaction you could have with the robot to ask question and explain wording and actions. If it is possibly then this could easier flowing passage of information. Intelligence and response of the robot would be crucial. As well as adapting the style when needed.,neutral
R_7r0yGOQ2nG4M70O,"Potentially, depending on the advancement of robots.  I think robots can be used to teach some technical topics, but not others.  Something like playing chess makes sense, but other more serious topics may not be appropriate.",neutral
R_4zJ7kSgnnoiiKHo,Yes they could - BUT might be that screen or VR based alternatives will be more appropriate and lower cost?,neutral
R_5CTxJ7lK5m4TSCf,"I think so. While this robot's explanation could be more comprehensive, it does a good job at clearly expressing what it does.",neutral
R_21CFjSyds5QELJf,"Not sure, I think in 10 years things will be more advanced than that",neutral
R_7JoZ4e1s8IMTNct,"Yes, and there could also be humanoid robots that mimic teachers which would make it seem more natural",positive
R_8FcfIDJVjVFXcHv,Yes as technology has been advancing very quickly,positive
R_816w9UU1DaYvFvZ,yes i think so because AI will become more intelligent. it already is very intelligent but will become more advanced and provide more services in line with what humans do now,positive
R_2oLoY7vaK8byc18,Yes it could because this helps with the learning since in person and not on a screen,positive
R_92Pcmt4dIdg755V,"I am not 100% sure, but I think they could replace screen based computers or at the very least augment them. The reason being that they would be able to physically show what the robot is doing and at the same time as it is doing it. I thing using robots also can have the appearance of being more interactive as it exists in the physical world, also robots are just cool.  ",neutral
R_4ig3zQOFkrpyJYS,"Yes, it is possible for robots to do such - if people can adapt and get used to such a shift. Not all humans may embrace such a change, even if technologically it is feasible and well more efficient.",neutral
R_25HhHDP3QnMa57l,"Robots may enhance but won’t fully replace screens in 10 years; cost, computing power, and adaptability still favor traditional computers. ",negative
R_8kFl04aReBVyTP5,I think in regards to replacing computer vision I feel that it most likely will not be replaced as far as I am aware that it would be highly costly and it would require much more advanced infrastructure. Thus the benefits would out weight the costs and it was not be effective.,negative
R_8XbtBvFchV4wtfw,"Yes, this is because we are in a technology age and things are changing rapidly.",positive
R_6k6V6DAJH6QrD3e,"I am not very knowledgeable on this but I believe that technologies like that develops rapidly and allows replacement of many different tools with the same or better functionality. So, yes I think it can serve as a replacement.",positive
R_2couDPIJotRn2kV,"Yes, only because there are a lot of health hazards to spending time on Computer screens in comparison to robots like this.",positive
R_30AEgkmSBG77RTw,"Yes  think it could and I think this robot demonstrates it well. I also think having something move, versus just watching something on a screen is more appealing, and would lead to more visual learning.",positive
R_61BXwLNApcZKBsl,"Yes. This is a better demonstration than an on screen computer as it shows firsthand how computer vision happens, and explains while doing so through the speaker.",positive
R_28M15DxFyL7QSO5,"Yes they could, as they provide practical demonstrations. ",positive
R_9InhEGdlFEv81WD,I believe it is possible as long as there is a practical component to the teachings. ,positive
R_7N2qpOF7C7D7A6O,"Hmmm, hard to say. I think screen-based computing will always prevail on a lot of things. I'd rather look at a diagram on a monitor than watch a robot draw the same diagram on a whiteboard, for example.  While the chess bot is cool, I think the concepts would be easier for me to understand, personally, if I were just reading about them on a monitor.",negative
R_2kOGM37Gbj3AzLP,I think it is possible because the robot is better at demonstrating practical aspects of a technical situation than a screen based computer is.,positive
R_28V8odNG5Bm60Ud,I think no because children prefer to use screens and it feels like a backwards step.,negative
R_87DKOB0tu4hf3Lb,Robots can replace existing screen-based computers. They can show how to accomplish technical tasks in 3 d and will be better able to simulate real-world scenarios. ,positive
R_8QtsvQAgowLbuDt,Yes. Because AI is gradually taking over different sectors of the world.,positive
R_80ZsrmfF3bDNYZ0,"Not a replacement entirely, but some times yes. It depends on what information is required.",neutral
R_8li4jt193Uo5jws,"yes, it seems to explain things clearly, and maybe voice is more accessible for 10 year olds. It also sounds unintimidating, whereas maybe children of that age would find written instructions a bit boring and intimidating, so it may be better in that way",positive
R_3yDMHpNQn4tiAal,"No, I do not believe, robots do not have emotions ",negative
R_69xwUtR8SWOH2XT,"Absolutely, especially with AI super intelligence, that could learn from the observers and make a tailor-made explanation that strives for maximize effectiveness in explaining the topic.",positive
R_6djeWIbJgOoRpgR,"It’s possible that robots like this could become more common as educational tools, but they are unlikely to fully replace screen-based computers. While robots can provide hands-on, interactive learning, computers offer greater flexibility for in-depth research, simulations, and large-scale accessibility. However, robots could complement traditional learning by providing a more immersive, real-world application of AI and computer vision concepts.",neutral
R_5ta1hFyhfc6yK8o,possible that robots can play a bigger role but high infrastructure and maintenance costs will likely limit widespread adoption,neutral
R_6WCoan6unMP4g02,"I assume this question is with respect to explaining computer vision to students who want to know how it works in detail.  In my experience having a real, hands-on example of something to study is infinitely better than having a computer simulated version of it (I assume that is what ""screen-based computers refers to).  It is way more fun/exciting to be able to peek and poke at something in real life.  Having said that, In 10 year I suspect (fear?) that AI will be creating the bulk of the software in the world, including the software use in robots.  As a result I do not think that in 10 years there will be a need for a class on computer vision to educate students.",neutral
R_4WT3ZV67AQDj1j8,"Yes, they would be valuable in showing real-world applications of technologies.",positive
R_2fCpd8YBVk6Pdlb,I DO NOT THINK THAT ROBOTS WOULD TAKE OVER COMPLETELY FROM EXISTING SCREEN COMPUTERS COS OF ETHICAL REASONS AND EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS  THAT PEOPLE HAVE CULTIVATED OVER THE YEARS. ,negative
R_3Ih0FguXopmtxPi,"Sure, providing budgets are able accommodate it. A computer screen may not be able to speak, but it is cheaper, and I know that in most learning environments, budgets can be tight. The functionality of the robot would have to justify its likely much greater price point.",neutral
R_3Ecp7veyfMzC2tb,"Most definitely, being able to watch in a three dimensionally is really helpful in memory and understanding a lot of things and could be adjusted to different versions of levels according to who this demo is being showed. At the same time, all in this life is not about technology and sometimes we need to exercise this ""muscle"" of our imagination and be able to grasp abstract things that makes us humans.  ",positive
R_6JOQ1GUqogFjWWu,"I think there will be ways that robots can be used in preference to screens within the next 10 years, but I think that the mobility and personalization of a personal screen will be hard to replace.  There might be replacement in certain environments to assist in learning.",neutral
R_1XaJ1PGDumAomuR,no. robots cannot explain in the way a human can because robots learn differently ,negative
R_3gOzOP5bnY54pyv,"If you mean that people would asked robots with voices to explain things instead of reading about them themselves... my answer is maybe. I'm sure those will exist--the kind of do already, with Siri or Alexa, but in my experience those types of programs are less helpful than manually looking on a topic on your own and reading about it (or watching a video) to learn about something at your own pace, in a way that works best for you. It's much easier to go back if you clicked the wrong link than to wait for the robot to finish its explanation if it's talking about the wrong topic; a screen also shows you multiple options at a time, but a screenless robot can only talk about one thing from one source.",negative
R_2v9dL1JWW9jNpfd,"Using robots to teach technical subjects like computer vision offers exciting potential.  Hands-on learning with robots could be more engaging and effective than screen-based methods, bridging theory and real-world applications. However, challenges include cost, complex software development, curriculum integration, accessibility, maintenance, and scalability.  While promising, widespread adoption requires addressing these hurdles.",neutral
R_87n6wN1iUhp00lb,Not sure but scientists are working hardly to improve the quality of robots ,neutral
R_81ARCNDoP9ZBn0b,yes possibly.it explains how it works which is a question lot of people have already and with the above vidieo it does that quite well,neutral
R_5lgluSIp8OToJsB,I am not sure if it would replace existing methods but it may be a larger alternative than it is now.,neutral
R_195niq2qeiLu6kc,i think so cause of how advance this robot is  it can help teach newcomers on how to adept to new technology.,positive
R_5EZF8P3mzB58UDf,I don't think it will replace existing screen-based computers because I think it will cost too much.,negative
R_7RPP0qg337rN9uy,"Yes I believe that is very possible! As some people tend to learn better when it is an more Hands-On experience, or when they can visually see the representation of the proper way(s) to do, and accomplish certain tasks, problems, & experiments! This is all of course if within the next 10 years we do make some prominent advances in ai and it being able to work with physical robot in-pairs without negative side effects so to speak.",positive
R_1uEepJvWS1I3OfZ,"As fast as AI is improving and evolving, I can see this happening in the next ten years if we put in the certain parameters to control it. We don't need any rogue A.I.",positive
R_1qypsIPnufmpQzx,"Maybe, but I find the voice to be irritating. I prefer more humanlike voices where the intonation and cadence is more natural.",neutral
R_8B2iM97Oek4EIMB,"I’m not sure, it depends on the practical usage. This particular robot seems to have a very specialised knowledge, whereas a screen based computer does many different things.",neutral
R_68FCUwYgg9kEKp9,I think it may be able to replace. It's good to be able to see and understand things with a 3d model. It makes visualization much easier. I think it is also more entertaining to watch,positive
R_8fHfbEIAzpaM9gt,"yes as Instead of passively reading or watching videos, you could engage in interactive conversations. ",positive
R_5CUIMQiwe7KvsBc,Yes definitely. In 10 years time robots would be cheaper to get and place in classroooms and wil be much more engaging for students to learn from it.  ,positive
R_8LkKzT92Vkd3zeF,Yes as technology advances I believe there will be a market for this type of computer based replacement. ,positive
R_8h6p636qUpObUHF,probably yes. i think it will be very useful for physical demonstrations of concepts,neutral
R_8YXKAE4qh584lHr,"Maybe, they look to be able to work out what is in front of them better.",neutral
R_5Pn33w6yljx6Uda,Not sure that this can replace computers,negative
R_4W5C6zoRTBmn4pH,"Could be, why not? Within 10 years robot quality might be really good, and the boom in AI could probably spurs the investment and development in robotic fields. ",neutral
R_3D0NwWA1A4pE3tL,"No, they are too bulky",negative
