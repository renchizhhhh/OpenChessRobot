R_3eqq7Gofo6sZ3Tk,"perhaps. probably not though, because of cost and too many are too lazy to be bothered.",negative
R_2PRhEWLA33MHCCt,"I do believe that within the next 10 years robots such as the one in the video could be a great replacement for other forms of entertainment such as television or social media because it would draw attention to its consumers due to it being a new creation. It would also be a great replacement because instead of just consuming people's attention, it could teach people while entertaining.",positive
R_5JDYIoEbzRXWboP,I do not think so because it is too boring.,negative
R_50hMUayYB7dptbW,"maybe if you are already into playing games but i dont think tv watchers are playing chess instead, not really the same way to spend free time",neutral
R_5BRFcotHZ32CgBb,"Yes I think so, it is already common for robots to preform human's jobs. In 10 years it will only be more advanced.",positive
R_2AKCElsCN3FK9e9,"yes, because our society desires more hands-on forms of automated entertainment.",positive
R_1HMrtTwxldcaIve,I don't think so because shows/movies have many elements tied into it and don't employ just 1 element of entertainment for us at a time. It wouldn't be enough to capture our attention and take away tv/,negative
R_5v37ckRvW5jDuz2,"Not entirely, it might be able to play games or talk to you but it's not passive like television. Sometimes you just want to sit and not think.",negative
R_5S96AhKtPgSLYAG,no. people want aspirational characters and robots are not,negative
R_362bLfXfeGY90qd,I do not think we are there yet with artificial intelligence in the next 10 years.,negative
R_741TQB2hCugISfQ,"yes and no, depending on the person and visual concept.",neutral
R_7pmTt43EB4E9l74,probably because they will outweigh humans and the way humans do things. make it more challenging for people,negative
R_1Qc0Q5jWLNG7lWu,TVs can show things from our imaginations that are not possible or costly. I don't think robots would be able to replace that. Robots would be a different form of entertainment.,negative
R_8sLUba6Bj7cTVSN,Possibly in 10 years robots will be better part of our life’s.,neutral
R_5oSbyWiQj0cOUuM,"I do not think this is possible because we are visual people. While robots could enrich this experience, it can't completely replace it. Not unless, VR capabilities were incorporated in someway.",negative
R_1ZBwPM4z8EnrpsF,Probably - because entertainment industry is very board and has alot of section and sub-section it's goig to take more than 10yrs to beat that,negative
R_86mSo0znBuAhmKo,I don’t think it will replace the television it won’t be able to provide the same service but it likely will be used for people who may feel lonely,negative
R_1ONNluNvvoPEB3j,Yes as it can entertain.,positive
R_8hlI43g7cB7VkfJ,Not really because some people like to watch screens.,negative
R_3EzcI77fiFaKakb,No. It8s too big and bulky when you could just play on your phone.,negative
R_5gMeUa9rNE0pVy3,"It can be an alternate form of entertainment, but not a replacement for TV. I think they serve different use cases.",negative
R_24zLd7xwQZCaKVB,yes probably but not  in that same was as its not entertaining enough,neutral
R_2knJLZKlu3lnkFr,Yes I think they provide could. I think as technology progresses people want to stay up to date. I'm not sure how it would work for me though,neutral
R_2oYpH8aVEKm4rE7,In part yes but I think it would need to be incorporated with it as people would miss tv too much I feel as a form of entertainment,neutral
R_2KWAQqdxzYLJZq9,"No, I think humans still need visual stimulation and we’ve gone beyond being entertained by real life.",negative
R_6wNway7wtiIDCvT,I dont think the robot is the same as a television but I can see it becoming its own form of entertaininment,neutral
R_3oI4z0ZViJ3hel7,"NO, I feel they could be useful, but I don't find it entertaining.",negative
R_8pMQufNlafHlfNH,"I don't know - I think that there will always be a space for tv's, tv shows etc",neutral
R_1rxmIDjp7jndp3J,I can't imagine wanting that kind of future and I don't know what it would look like,negative
R_7Qv4UZYKvGJRRJL,"Yes, since they are more hands on and functional entertainment.",positive
R_8L2do58ywi65zzk,"No, because this robot is quite interactive, and screen-based forms of entertainment will never be replaced.",negative
R_8fFEJdxcJsOf0xH,"Maybe not a replace for television which is quite one dimensional, anyway. But surely as a replacement for computer games and other forms of interactive content / media",neutral
R_5WYHIaXzbkIfYVa,sure. robots are every where,neutral
R_8smEqSPjgR0RPem,yes robots can do so much already and have replaced a lot of jobs,positive
R_8PIHbOaBa334bnz,Possibly as an adjunct. I think screen based forms will stay for quite awhile.,neutral
R_20SU39XHZo1tTwH,I think there will be a market for it but I think many people just prefer passive entertainment in their downtime.,neutral
R_8JfId6CJsLxtpyF,No. There is no entertainment value in watching the robot. The movement and sound of the robot distracts from the narrative.,negative
R_8ZZA0VSZvSAqA9a,"I think they are more suited to mechanise activities rather than for entertainment. Television presents proper people, moving and talking, presenting stories. Robots just move.",negative
R_8QRR470DokrX0rZ,It might replace the existing screen in future,neutral
R_7hzgzQnLQ2bWjFT,I think there is a good possibility.  Real world interaction will always be stronger than simply a screen.,positive
R_5JqRqqsI9E395uh,"No, it’s just so different from screen based entertainment it does not have the range to replicate what happens on tv. Tv has the capacity to portray so many character and situation.",negative
R_8iIRQ6j6XJxJyos,"I don't think it will replace those things, but it could definitely help or be a complementary form of entertainment. But it comes down to ease of access and what you can actually do with it. We thought VR was going to become a big thing but that seems quite niche due to the prices of headsets.  If this kind of robot can only handle chess/board games it will only ever have a very small niche.  Also, at the end of the day you really can't beat watching a film/playing a video game.",negative
R_2mq7e5z0vVKUjMA,"potentially. it depends where the development of screen technology gets, especially due to recent developments in wearable tech in the past few years.",neutral
R_22M2AjmbyMpL1mm,"No, I don't believe so. I think the likes of AR will be the prominent entertainment form in the coming decades.",negative
R_2TIlAWtWDeaYUkp,Potentially but I think there would need to be improvements with the technology to keep up with the progress in 10 years,neutral
R_7lGiSAvlNsTvDiV,"No, certainly not television as they occupy different niches and this robot would likely not be able to play out a complex social storyline like one might see in a show. But I could see this taking the place of apps or online games like chess.com in many ways.",neutral
R_8lzxGU2jOe37rq1,"Yes if their size and form is more sophisticated. Also, this firm of entertainment seems more enjoyable than a PlayStation or X box",positive
R_5rOFdn51mfIU2L7,"I don't think they would replace TV's, since TV programs are varied and set in realistic locations etc. Having a robot to talk to or be a companion wouldn't be equivalent to what TV or screens offer.",negative
R_2OOko4C3totDlIZ,"Not a replacement, but if I was learning to play chess, I'd rather do it with something like this than at a PC",neutral
R_24sYPI3RwKDNbQB,Yes because it would allow for people to get a different form of entertainment,positive
R_8q8MzGsmeSa9T8m,I think it would be cool to play against people online using a physical board where the pieces are moved by the robot,neutral
R_8EYA5Al9QNek50k,"I don’t think they would be used as entertainment, unless it’s opponent was human. It wouldn’t be very entertaining and would have a certain winner if programmed to do so ",negative
R_8diCNCf6rCFvs2r,"Definitely, with some work and improvements, robots could be a form of entertainment. As they rely on AI or connected to the internet, they have a wealth of information it could tap into, so there is a wider variety of ways to entertain the user based on the user's specific interests.",positive
R_8QLnyKsBGgnOELM,Possibly not because with screen based entertainment there is more variety where as this does one thing.,negative
R_4wMhVob6VXRfTNv,yeah absolutely but they need to be made more human,positive
R_2g0pzEhdcRkdQQQ,No I believe they will not replace conventional entertainment as I dont think they serve very good visual stimuli and the audio arent very interesting.,negative
R_8N7XS4frNMhBEcR,No- nothing can replace the real entertainment of television ,negative
R_84MJ4pooEJ4Kq8D,"I think they can, they are already doing so much. they can act as one device with all forms of entertainment and screen and let fo the use of remote to operate. ",positive
R_7W6WESfeUZdm2oV,no it’s clunky and large and would be too expensive,negative
R_8OCXI98XluohHDC,"Robots might add new, immersive experiences, but they’re unlikely to fully replace the simplicity and mass appeal of screen-based content",negative
R_6fqftFb1dzyOaH4,Yes I think robots will eventually replace entertainment because technology is advancing rapidly.,positive
R_8B3P7hBf6gBtXRX,I can see it happening but I don’t think it will fully replace current entertainment as it is more accessible the way it is now.,neutral
R_71DoJ12LUehrWff,"I think in some cases for sure, in this case it makes the user feel like he is playing against a real life opponent",neutral
R_87qgVKTXoJWNY3T,"No, people need to watch real people on the screen, not robots, we are as humans not ready for this kind of change yet",negative
R_8qaMj9uvzxKKCer,i dont think so. maybe i just dont have a good imagination but i cant understand what for. ,negative
R_2feDdmGE5um9eDH,"Don’t think so, a screen is far more flexible.",negative
R_8OG20dF268viX3b,"Perhaps, it all depends on the experience. If touch was a factor then someone would be able to feel they would interacting more realistically with another person etc. ",neutral
R_5nlnhT3lVhVBxUw,"No, as screens no matter a TV or phone will always be a thing and they are always improving.",negative
R_639lQXCaPrD2wG1,"No, I think there is room for both things. People will always love sitting and watching tv. But this would be a different form of entertainment ",neutral
R_8YbL1EGMItqUgBN,There might be scope for a robot providing entertainment but watching films and tv are passive activities and a robot would be more useful in interactive situations.,neutral
R_36fNTn997q9xztW,"No I don't, people desire to watch other people and have since the days of Shakespeare and the stage. Although i believe it would still be an interesting novelty instead of a replacement. ",negative
R_511bADMoDcYjEAN,"yes, unfortunately.  I think in 10 yrs robots will be everywhere",negative
R_5c2jwMgveysPvG1,Absolutely not. This robot could be more of an assistance than entertainment.,negative
R_8TGzEpgzIthaENd,"No, movies and animation will probably still be in high demand, and although this is a cool concept, it can't replicate movies and cinema.",negative
R_1NCxKnaHkxg0omf,"No, this is dated technology.",negative
R_59omDQqEETjqOZK,"No, Robots aren't that interesting to watch all day. ",negative
R_3dLeUYMyHNKqmfm,No. TV takes you to a different reality where your not in your life anymore. It's a version if escapism. You can't get that with robots. You cna have a version of companionship but it won't replace escapism. ,negative
R_8YwY8usoZf3Gm6U,Definitely with the improvement in innovations in artificial intelligence the 10 years time-span could be shorter,positive
R_8M4olzMafYNMxl3,"No, screens will not be replaced",negative
R_81b7jyDcPYxVahz,"With required laws and scrutinising in place, AI based robots can be part of teaching skills, games and entertainment. ",neutral
R_6JQJlOqN4db7fCO,No. No one wants robots to take over the world. ,negative
R_2faYvLYX3Pqi8al,Probably not. People like screens. People like passive. People don't like noisy machinery whirring around.,negative
R_84nEA68TKOUfoMp,"Of course, like the created robot above I could have chess matches which would prevent me over-indulging in screen times. Lots of people don't do things because they are alone (ie have a chess partner), so this would change that.",positive
R_4P5gzq8kB9mGL45,Maybe. If AI is incorporated,neutral
R_84Hrbp3wlncoFae,"No it's not the same at all. Listening to the robot is sort of entertaining, but it's nothing like the sensory experience of watching a TV show, following its characters, taking in the settings and the objects on screen.",negative
R_8COxlEPvu5PCZgg,I believe they could undertake certain tasks but couldn't fully replace human conversation ,negative
R_8rZQjmc2Sy8uAjg,I don't think they would replace a screen for movies totally no. They could be used for entertainment though without doubt,neutral
R_8eqcjeFwVv6NoPg,"I don't believe so. The robot's abilities appear finite and most people would be get bored soon after, whereas entertainment is comparatively limitless on screens.",negative
R_9Ck3wzwhFtihMPE,"No, television is a different sort of entertainment and couldn’t be replaced in this way",negative
R_8YxDqIX99XeQc74,"Yes I do, as artificial intelligence is improving daily and I do think it will be a huge part of our lives in the future.",positive
R_8qXhQlvnw6RJhf3,I don't think that this would replace human entertainment,negative
R_2O6pssDpjblhGXd,I don't think so as this is not as multi-use as a computer.,negative
R_21HQB9wnACxYbBG,"I think so because at this point , it allows you to prompt it and give instructions to it , which it gives you the response you probably want. It might get to the point of reminding you on alarms and the movies and channel that might be useful to you ",positive
R_25WNktw70XCKN9N,"I don’t thinks so, because robots still rely humans for working they are not fully autonomous and I don’t think they will ",negative
R_8r60nFT48EWoUL9,"Probably not, because people will want to watch TV for entertainment purposes, which robots are unable to act out full scenes etc.",negative
R_6WxYwMiywWUgPFn,"It definitely could because people already use other things that are more accessible/portable than TV such as smartphones, laptops, or other handheld devices",positive
R_6MMS4ILBRBGUVP6,Maybe but it would be cost and functionality limited ,neutral
R_52gy5wQBh5OvwGm,yes because the world will be running romoely,positive
R_4phBIyXpUEA2Lwg,I think they could but they still don't feel as relatable as a real human would,neutral
R_21NBDzSUkXsPuud,"I do not think robots will replace all scree-based entertainment. Movies and tv programs would still be including real people and robots cannot replace that. Perhaps some forms of entertainment can include robots more, i.e. recreational sports, console games.",negative
R_3dX9RQg9gxEF2yC,"I dont think so, maybe for a specific type of people but I personally did not find this interesting and would still much rather watch the movie on a screen, ",negative
R_8P6flJKcdFm1DHj,I think this sort of entertainment would be more engaging but people also want more passive entertainment over longer periods ,neutral
R_3OOijoZgBxluhOO,"I think they could, but tv is way bigger than this",neutral
R_3xADPAg6GKe3RC1,I dont think so; I dont think there have been enough improvements on the vocal and personality aspects of robots....yet,negative
R_2RaVBmS1u2kS5eO,Not a replacement but something that would serve as a form of entertainment alongside things like televisions,neutral
R_6bzwaHhdSn04r0B,It could but it needs a lot more work. TV is too addictive for everyone including pets and social media is even more addictive.  Find a replacement for those and you are rich for lifetimes.  ,neutral
R_8AYjves5E09DdDj,"Yes, i think the more technology advances the more it can become part of our daily lifes. Maybe help engage people, rather than being behind screens. Having an interactive robot could provide so much more entertainment, than mind numbing and unstimulating television shows",positive
R_8CfdmC9uIOQiCqZ,"It depends on the situation, I could see this as automated for household chores.",neutral
R_9Vg5C5OOoahk7oM,I would say so as they are a bit more advanced which could provide better entertainment.,positive
R_2YGrDdpyxjVfFgi,"No, they have no tone or facial expression",negative
R_2qJM34eSyeAHaXp,"No, it is slower, louder, has less utility, and takes up more space than a digital display.",negative
R_814sPTpJPpGPHrP,i think so robots have already come a long way,positive
R_5Z1i1dYch0bH1AZ,yes i think it can be and i think it could use more tweaking to be perfect but its good enough to have in 10 years,positive
R_5oXVqrBiTdmrRxR,Yes they will serve as a replacement because of their accuracy and delivery,positive
R_2GxMjZxDgqDNcuQ,"No, absolutely not. Robots like these, and including this, are trained on other people's work, often the screen-based entertainment mentioned. Without that material, it would be significantly more difficult for AI/robots to be trained.",negative
R_3qCZAwMPdSzFdw5,"I believe robots like this one will serve as a supplement for entertainment, in addition to screen-based forms. It will be very difficult to entirely replace television because it is so embedded in our society and existence. ",neutral
R_3JpBR0V1nLk4jEl,"No, I think that people prefer visual entertainment. ",negative
R_8h6GNtNP3rUsvMI,What's the point in playing chess with a robot when you could just play online with an AI on or a human on Chess.com?,negative
R_3VL8qRmOKeWvHbY,I’m not sure but if they used it in a positive way with learning tools it would be more beneficial to society ,neutral
R_8EhG0QgLRULb9JL,I do not think they could replace other forms of entertainment as I think what they would be able to do both technically and theoretically would not be particularly entertaining. If it is static in a home I cannot see many potential use cases for entertainment.,negative
R_2oSfCQF25sK9PXw,"i dont think so , i dont think that tv will ever be replaced by robots . tv has been around too long and as a race it is inbuilt in us to watch ",negative
R_8s0RpYlhgPx0yS4,No. I feel like tv is just easy and provides enough entertainment. ,negative
R_2FRHptRTFnrbXmp,No. There is too high a cost and people would get bored with the robots. TV has a lot more to offer and is much easier to use.,negative
R_7qInihKkpRceS3J,I don’t think so. They’re large and bulky. They aren’t portable. ,negative
R_2F2mhvQbarhNpxl,"Probably not, unless they incorporated a screen into the robot perhaps? ",neutral
R_5KqCrMFGHUyVqZL,Definitely because more interactive.,positive
R_6c6DPe0IFlAkzik,"Not really, the robot is only able to move objects and talk, there is no screen and it is not very entertaining to watch it.",negative
R_65apGsEDsPlMpOx,"No, I don't think this robot like this would be able to replace a TV or tablet in 10 years, I think it would need a lot more tweeks and must have more aesthetically pleasing features. I'm sure it will replace us within another 50 years when technology is better. To be fair, we've only recently got AI automated cars.",negative
R_7cjLueNOoH5zJx7,Hmmm I don't think so. Tv will always be around,negative
R_1ffJP1gYJXCwvFL,"No, I do not believe that within 10 years, robots like this could feasibly become a widespread, accepted replacement of existing screen entertainment. While cool and exciting, it seems much more like a novelty product rather than an everyday replacement. It seems one-note, not capable of doing the multifaceted tasks of our other entertainment devices such as cellphones, computers or frankly even television. I think it is a cool idea, however I see it finding more of a home in places like museums of sorts, communal public spaces or classrooms.",negative
R_2bOVJvxFj1yGYUx,possibly depending how it is implemented if it can be used with various things it could offer a more personalised home entertainment experience eventually,neutral
R_6QF48fpEppRXQPv,Robots like this would probably not completely replace screen based forms of entertainment in 10 years. A lot more time would be needed for a generational shift in preferences. The robot seems a bit bulky and is less space efficient than screen based technology. It may also still be unaffordable for households.,negative
R_8GgwASP8Hrb89rj,"I think it will be , cause people are getting lazy and they want  someone to do work for them ",positive
R_3PGgvFSkbniJPJj,"No probably not, as they take up too much room ",negative
R_2shkNDRgXjSmPkR,"Yes, robots can be used for entertainment but not sure that they will replace television, will expect people will still want to watch movies and series and or other programs",neutral
R_88vPznpJUQJxIcN,"I don't think the robots could replace existing forms of entertainment as they would ultimately not be able to provide the emotional connection/be interesting enough to entertain people the same way movies/tv does, I think most people find robots like these a fun novelty for a small amount of time but quickly move on.",negative
R_2Cl5QMdC9ayXoSB,"Hopefully not, it's not exactly entertaining to watch. It's just creepy.",negative
R_8nGRvrmPSvGZWo1,It's a gimmick.  You can't watch cricket or a movie on a robot.,negative
R_8CfI8LCc5TqF1qj,"Yes, I could definitely envisage that for sure. I think TV is going to be less and less important in peoples lives, this is already evident. I think if these robots could retail at a reasonable price they would definitely be an option.",positive
R_9DpCPIBN5QHSU77,I don’t think so - I think it’s function is quite limited and don’t think it could reasonably replace existing forms of entertainment ,negative
R_1DnAQE48HAEKCFI,"No, since people enjoy passive forms of entertainment like watching something on a screen, not just more active forms like video games or board games. I think there is an uncomfortable factor of being watched or having something that too closely approaches sentience / consciousness just waiting on you like a servant that most people would not enjoy.",negative
R_4gjUBYa4qHu4jXN,"Nope. If the last 10 years of technological advancement has taught me anything, it's that people are increasingly engaging with entertainment that requires less and less effort (i.e scrolling on TikTok and watching streaming services). I expect that this kind of robot would be too much effort to setup and maintain for most people and would be reserved for chess enthusiasts only.",negative
R_81GdDzSxaJiGYMF,I hope not. Humans are still the artists in this universe and it would be such a shame if our entertainment will be in the hands of robots.,negative
R_8aHhb65oG82KJUt,"Not for me , I would rather watch humans in shows films etc than  artificial AI",negative
R_2Pq8r7O233Ef271,I don't think so. Robots are a very niche market in terms of human interaction. ,negative
R_2LmgQXVJxRlGTaF,Yes I probably do. Heaven knows what kind of Tech already exists and will certainly exist in the near future. Frightening really (for me anyway),neutral
R_2I9vDzdgCRwbvQb,"i believe it could, interaction based can be more friendly and also reduces addiction to screen",positive
R_8fltKCWjqdQFv5O,"No, too expensive and not useful",negative
R_5cTIuquwC9qRHZn,No. It requires more space and energy.,negative
R_1r9pBOOwldUwxDC,"I don't think robots could serve as an entire replacement for things such as T.V. as it doesn't necessarily fulfill all the aspects I enjoy about other forms of entertainment. For example, for games, I would enjoy interacting directly with the game and being able to enjoy different forms of different genres of games. For T.V., a robot wouldn't be able to replicate the drama or showwriting of a particular T.V. show or feature actors I enjoy. Therefore, I don't think robots could serve as replacements because they are completely different forms of technology in themselves.",negative
R_8hzrvxgtigSnbpV,I would say probably not as no matter how good robots are designed and made they are still slow in movement and TV has so much variety at the touch of a button.,negative
R_7yIT4EXpIbXIKuB,"I don't think robots could serve as a replacement for television because television often has colours, dialogue, and certain parts to it that make it engaging in a way that robots might struggle to replicate. While robots could provide interactive experiences, they may not give the same level of storytelling, emotional depth, or artistry found in movies and TV shows.  ",negative
R_3htrqbMbPxqElfw,"Maybe for certain people. I don’t think it could replace watching human drama, action, romance or comedy shows for the majority of people who enjoy those things",negative
R_5xC98pQBYATkQZH,"no, not entirely. The robot should be far more advanced and have a human designed body",negative
R_8e8WD0qHQa4efEv,Probably not as it is not interactive enough for most people at this stage.,negative
R_8cutV5OnxSpn8TQ,No i don't think robots are entertaining in the same way as a television,negative
R_2PdM70F5hHveRh7,Yes. I think improvements in screen based entertainment are trying to bring a more immersive experience by making it as real as possible. Robots provide the opportunity to make significant aspects actually real.,positive
R_8JEAJcmQKGi35oN,"while i do believe they have a place in entertainment in the future, television and the comforts that come with it are still key to the human experience, I see robots in a more auxiliary role for entertainment.",neutral
R_25zQXxnKAB1gtr3,"I don't think they will replace screen based forms of entertainment because when you watch tv you switch off and relax and immerse yourself in to a place that's different to where you are. With the robot you have to think and respond to it, which is what people do all day at work. ",negative
R_81z2xcrbSx1C4fs,"I don’t think so, humans crave human interactions.  I also think we are too hooked to technology now, so much so that we will get bored.",negative
R_80JeSwjnNEqQInW,yes. Content could be far more tailored to a person's individual tastes,positive
R_8Cka6NlQmRKZAOd,I don’t think they would replace things like tvs or gaming consoles as people like to mindlessly relax with these forms of entertainment. I do think they could exist alongside however depending on price .people that maybe lonely may benefit particularly if they looked less mechanical ie someone to play chess with if you live alone .,neutral
R_2QQfvepFmQFhzKB,"no, technology not there",negative
R_8iHth3U7GiqdRnP,no because it would lack the visual representation that tv allows,negative
R_2dXn1A2XRmp1kuf,"potentially, but i don’t see these robots replacing the creativity of real people. ",negative
R_3e8fYydMKUTa6se,"I would hope not, but I do think they provide entertainment for many people. ",negative
R_8DcK5epBgJWqJjB,"I really don’t think having a robot play chess would serve as a television replacement firstly robots as chess players will eliminate the human experience of playing chess, whereas television is mainly for visual entertainment robots cannot replace the viewing pleasure from televisions ",negative
R_3KDtAKvKLOWjEXv,Probably not because a lot of people use social media and enjoy seeing other people online.,negative
R_2DeD2N9iYAlgFWa,"I doubt that this kind of robot would replace entertainment such as TV. It is not as visually stimulating as TV. The personal and/or aspect of some forms of TV, such as game shows, seems to be extremely important. Although I don’t this  kind of robot will replace TV I would expect it’s popularity to increase over the next 10 years. A parallel example is quiz shows versus online quizzes. Whilst the popularity of the former increases I doubt that it will completely replace person hosted quizzes.",negative
R_8b8Nj6a65ees73X,"It depends on the level of advancement in robotics and AI. If robots become highly interactive, emotionally intelligent, and capable of adapting entertainment to individual preferences, they could challenge traditional screen-based entertainment.",neutral
R_2DOoeu5zDyU5D71,I don't think they would be a replacement but they would probably add to the entertainment as an extra. The television shows much more visual things which the robot cannot provide. ,negative
R_32MZ0vNUSs3kLpT,"No, it's not nearly as accessible, mass produce-able, or even entertaining. Screen based devices can be made for incredibly cheap and last a long time, a complex robot such as this would cost several hundreds of dollars to produce, even more to buy, and does not have an extensive track record of good functioning. Also, social media's ability to captivate attention can't be understated. People who's attentions are easily swayed will always go to effortless sources of entertainment like Tiktok, and people who try to consume mindfully will usually go less technological forms of entertainment, so outside of a niche audience of mostly rich tech enthusiasts, I don't see anyone being excited about this for entertainment.",negative
R_5Xp1F4UcYa27Mrw,maybe but it will depend on the end-user preferences,neutral
R_2Ojyo5KqGVpZdjA,Yes because they are intriguing and intelligent or have a multitude of knowledge ,positive
R_6b2k5HhcR48TQbp,i don't think a robot can replace a television. watching shows and interacting with an ai is two different kind of entertainment. the only way that this robot can replace a television is if he would have an integrated screen playing our favorite shows,negative
R_8pYwwfRWbjRwqGp,"Not really in my opinion, but they can perform some entertainment and also complement humans. Screen  based form of entertainment can provide a variety of entertainment as compared to robots which can only a few.",neutral
